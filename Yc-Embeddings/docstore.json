from Y Combinator offer up an amazing course in \"How To Start A Startup\" at Stanford. Course\nincludes lectures from: Sam Altman, Dustin Moskovitz, Paul Graham, Adora Cheung, Peter Thiel, Alex Schultz, Kevin\nHale, Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, Ben Silbermann, Alfred Lin, Patrick and John Collison, Aaron Levie, Reid\nHoffman, Keith Rabois, Ben Horowitz, Marissa Mayer, Hosian Rahman, Kirsty Nathoo, Carolynn Levy, and more.\nThe trasncript was taken from \ngeius.com\n. I created this book for those who prefer reading over watching for the sake of\nefficiency.\nI wrote numerous notes in Chinese here: \nhttp://zhibimo.com/explore/growth\n.\nCS183B is a class we're teaching at Stanford. It's designed to be a sort of one-class business course for people\nwho want to start startups.\nVideos of the lectures, associated reading materials, and assignments will all be available here. There will be 20\nvideos, some with a speaker or two and some with a small panel. It'll be 1,000 minutes of content if you watch it all.\nWe'll cover how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and\nmarketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and\nmore.\nYou can't teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising\namount. We've tried to take some of the best speakers from the past 9 years of Y Combinator dinners and arrange\nthem in a way that will hopefully make sense.\nWe're doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for\neveryone. It will hopefully be valuable even for people who don't want to start startups. \nTalks like these have really\nhelped Y Combinator founders create their companies. We hope you find it helpful too!\n-Sam\nLecture 1: How to Start a Startup by \nSam Altman\nLecture 2: Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part II by \nSam Altman\nHow to Start a Startup\nEverything we know about how to start a startup, for free, from some of the world\nexperts.\nDescription\nxiaolai's Notes\nA letter from Sam Altman, President at YCombinator about the course:\nTable of Content", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2363, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ca8c940-99a7-40da-84c8-a49575008d44": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ca8c940-99a7-40da-84c8-a49575008d44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2553c14-eaf5-45b5-9c9d-59fd487c2c63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "ed935634780c2f9b95d53139e65d5f5afaa3aeafb37bab9f8f914edf29870913", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f9b28fe-0b4a-48ac-aea7-3bb99faa8063", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "eafe13e818cd1b8d67798e3ab7917479b90b6b64e60c7966358f21231b29e60d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1843cbda-0676-486b-b1ac-6b4f9cea9f15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4af953191b8bce84238cbd6160cf5486b949ce1a706bba91627adcc798a12b6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c5d85e94256d35a6f8f74b633989c282e01dd11e8fb0dd75b274a92b72894d1a", "text": "Lecture 3: Counterintuitive Parts of Startups, and How to Have Ideas by \nPaul Graham\nLecture 4: Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing by \nAdora Cheung\nLecture 5: Business Strategy and Monopoly Theory by \nPeter Thiel\nLecture 6: Growth by \nAlex Schultz\nLecture 7: How to Build Products Users Love, Part I by \nKevin Hale\nLecture 8: Doing Things That Don't Scale, PR, and How to Get Started by \nWalker Williams\nLecture 9: How to Raise Money by \nMarc Andreessen\nLecture 10: Company Culture and Building a Team, Part I by \nAlfred Lin\nLecture 11: Company Culture and Building a Team, Part II by \nPatrick Collison\nLecture 12: Sales and Marketing by \nAaron\nLecture 13: How To Be A Great Founder by \nReid Hoffman\nLecture 14: How to Operate by \nKeith Rabois\nLecture 15: How to Manage by \nB Horowitz\nLecture 16: How to Run a User Interview by \nEmmett Shear\nLecture 17: How to Build Products Users Love, Part II by \nHosain Rahman\nLecture 18: Mechanics--Legal, Finance, HR, etc. by \nKirsty Nathoo\nLecture 19: Sales and Marketing, How to Pitch, and Investor Meeting Roleplaying by \nTyler Bosmeny\nLecture 20: Closing Thoughts and Later-Stage Advice by \nSam Altman", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1843cbda-0676-486b-b1ac-6b4f9cea9f15": {"__data__": {"id_": "1843cbda-0676-486b-b1ac-6b4f9cea9f15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8285fc11-4a36-4aa9-a106-a5d4554f94b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "3e13a82cef88c0add45597207da7df81ef5acae81050733d6b4612999ae21086", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ca8c940-99a7-40da-84c8-a49575008d44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "c5d85e94256d35a6f8f74b633989c282e01dd11e8fb0dd75b274a92b72894d1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c899c02f-2a3f-4a6d-808c-1422e158ef17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c795362c652efcb2bed2977a8f1b815a4c3aa3812e8c9a169b8a393a63e1d2b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4af953191b8bce84238cbd6160cf5486b949ce1a706bba91627adcc798a12b6d", "text": "Welcome to CS183B. I am Sam Altman, I'm the President of Y Combinator. Nine years ago, I was a Stanford student, and\nthen I dropped out to start a company and then I've been an investor for the last few. So YC, we've been teaching people\nhow to start startups for nine years. Most of it's pretty specific to the startups but thirty percent of it is pretty generally\napplicable. And so we think we can teach that thirty percent in this class. And even though that's only thirty percent of the\nway there, hopefully it will still be really helpful.\nWe've taught a lot of this class at YC and it's all been off the record. And this is the first time a lot of what we teach is going\nto be on the record. We've invited some of our guest speakers to come and give the same talks they give at YC. We've\nnow funded 725 companies and so we're pretty sure a lot of this advice we give is pretty good. We can't fund every\nstartup yet, but we can hopefully make this advice very generally available.\nI'm only teaching three. Counting YC itself, every guest speaker has been involved in the creation of a billion plus dollar\ncompany. So the advice shouldn't be that theoretical, it's all been people who have done it.\nAll of the advice in this class is geared towards people starting a business where the goal is hyper growth and eventually\nbuilding a very large company. Much of it doesn't apply in other cases and I want to warn people up front, that if you try to\ndo these things in a lot of big companies or non-startups, it won't work. It should still be interesting, I really think that\nstartups are the way of the future and it's worth trying to understand them, but startups are very different than normal\ncompanies. So over the course of today and Thursday, I'm going to try to give an overview of the four areas you need to\nexcel at in order to maximize your success as a startup. And then throughout the course, the guest speakers are going to\ndrill into all of these in more detail.\nIdeas, Products, Teams and Execution Part I\nSo the four areas: You need a great idea, a great product, a great team, and great execution. These overlap somewhat,\nbut I'm going to have to talk about them somewhat individually to make it make sense.\nYou may still fail. The outcome is something like idea x product x execution x team x luck, where luck is a random number\nbetween zero and ten thousand. Literally that much. But if you do really well in the four areas you can control, you have a\ngood chance at at least some amount of success.\nOne of the exciting things about startups is that they are a surprisingly even playing field. Young and inexperienced, you\ncan do this. Old and experienced, you can do this, too. And one of the things that I particularly like about startups is that\nsome of the things that are bad in other work situations, like being poor and unknown, are actually huge assets when it\ncomes to starting a startup.\nBefore we jump in on the how, I want to talk about why you should start a startup. I'm somewhat hesitant to be doing this\nclass at all because you should never start a startup just for the sake of doing so. There are much easier ways to become\nrich and everyone who starts a startup always says, always, that they couldn't have imagined how hard and painful it was\ngoing to be. You should only start a startup if you feel compelled by a particular problem and that you think starting a\ncompany is the best way to solve it.\nThe specific passion should come first, and the startup second. In fact, all of the classes we have at YC follow this. So for\nthe second half of today's lecture, Dustin Moskovitz is going to take over and talk about why to start a startup. We were so\nsurprised at the amount of attention this class got, that we wanted to make sure we spent a lot of time on the why.\nThe first of the four areas: a great idea. It's become popular in recent years to say that the idea doesn't matter. In fact, it's\nuncool to spend a lot of time thinking about the idea for a startup. You're just supposed to start, throw stuff at the wall, see\nLecture 1: How to Start a Startup\nSam Altman", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c899c02f-2a3f-4a6d-808c-1422e158ef17": {"__data__": {"id_": "c899c02f-2a3f-4a6d-808c-1422e158ef17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c38cede6-ed7d-4995-8f2d-08c9197a22a0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "bbd74c5c8dbd674f2ddc26d91713e509468596f3f7cdf8d5f6ca9f8350cfbd32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1843cbda-0676-486b-b1ac-6b4f9cea9f15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "4af953191b8bce84238cbd6160cf5486b949ce1a706bba91627adcc798a12b6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "309575ae-9a15-4669-8dc3-d9c04506d3a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ba4b9a68a52998f08f6131965a679e6ee1ad09189637a4c923ad71ae4d0ab5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c795362c652efcb2bed2977a8f1b815a4c3aa3812e8c9a169b8a393a63e1d2b9", "text": "what sticks, and not even spend any time thinking about if it will be valuable if it works.\nAnd pivots are supposed to be great, the more pivots the better. So this isn't totally wrong, things do evolve in ways you\ncan't totally predict. And there's a limit to how much you can figure out without actually getting a product in the hands of\nthe users. And great execution is at least ten times as important and a hundred times harder than a great idea.\nBut the pendulum has swung way out of whack. A bad idea is still bad and the pivot-happy world we're in today feels\nsuboptimal. Great execution towards a terrible idea will get you nowhere. There are exceptions, of course, but most great\ncompanies start with a great idea, not a pivot.\nIf you look at successful pivots, they almost always are a pivot into something the founders themselves wanted, not a\nrandom made up idea. Airbnb happened because Brian Chesky couldn't pay his rent, but he had some extra space. In\ngeneral though if you look at the track record of pivots, they don't become big companies. I myself used to believe ideas\ndidn't matter that much, but I'm very sure that's wrong now.\nThe definition of the idea, as we talk about it, is very broad. It includes the size and the growth of the market, the growth\nstrategy for the company, the defensibility strategy, and so on. When you're evaluating an idea, you need to think through\nall these things, not just the product. If it works out, you're going to be working on this for ten years so it's worth some real\nup front time to think through the up front value and the defensibility of the business. Even though plans themselves are\nworthless, the exercise of planning is really valuable and totally missing in most startups today.\nLong-term thinking is so rare anywhere, but especially in startups. There is a huge advantage if you do it. Remember that\nthe idea will expand and become more ambitious as you go. You certainly don't need to have everything figured out in\nyour path to world domination, but you really want a nice kernel to start with. You want something that can develop in\ninteresting ways.\nAs you're thinking through ideas, another thing we see that founders get wrong all the time is that someday you need to\nbuild a business that is difficult to replicate. This is an important part of a good idea.\nI want to make this point again because it is so important: the idea should come first and the startup should come second.\nWait to start a startup until you come up with an idea you feel compelled to explore. This is also the way to choose\nbetween ideas. If you have several ideas, work on the one that you think about most often when you're not trying to think\nabout work. What we hear again and again from founders is that they wish they had waited until they came up with an\nidea they really loved.\nAnother way of looking at this is that the best companies are almost always mission oriented. It's difficult to get the amount\nof focus that large companies need unless the company feels like it has an important mission. And it's usually really hard\nto get that without a great founding idea. A related advantage of mission oriented ideas is that you yourself will be\ndedicated to them. It takes years and years, usually a decade, to build a great startup. If you don't love and believe in\nwhat you're building, you're likely to give up at some point along the way. There's no way I know of to get through the pain\nof a startup without the belief that the mission really matters. A lot of founders, especially students, believe that their\nstartups will only take two to three years and then after that they'll work on what they're really passionate about. That\nalmost never works. Good startups usually take ten years.\nA third advantage of mission oriented companies is that people outside the company are more willing to help you. You'll\nget more support on a hard, important project, than a derivative one. When it comes to starting a startup, it's easier to\nfound a hard startup than an easy startup.

It's difficult to overstate how important being mission driven is, so I want to state it one last time: derivative\ncompanies, companies that copy an existing idea with very few new insights, don't excite people and they don't compel\nthe teams to work hard enough to be successful.\nPaul Graham is going to talk about how to get startup ideas next week. It's something that a lot of founders struggle with,\nbut it's something I believe you can get better at with practice and it's definitely worth trying to get better at.\nThe hardest part about coming up with great ideas, is that the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.

Most people thought that was pointless. Search\nwas done, and anyways, it didn't matter that much. Portals were where the value was at. The tenth social network, and\nlimited only to college students with no money? Also terrible. MySpace has won and who wants college students as\ncustomers? Or a way to stay on strangers' couches. That just sounds terrible all around.\nThese all sounded really bad but they turned out to be good. If they sounded really good, there would be too many\npeople working on them. As Peter Thiel is going to discuss in the fifth class, you want an idea that turns into a monopoly.\nBut you can't get a monopoly right away. You have to find a small market in which you can get a monopoly and then\nquickly expand. This is why some great startup ideas look really bad at the beginning. It's good if you can say something\nlike, \"Today, only this small subset of users are going to use my product, but I'm going to get all of them, and in the future,\nalmost everyone is going to use my product.\"\nHere is the theme that is going to come up a lot: you need conviction in your own beliefs and a willingness to ignore\nothers' naysaying. The hard part is that this is a very fine line. There's right on one side of it, and crazy on the other. But\nkeep in mind that if you do come up with a great idea, most people are going to think it's bad. You should be happy about\nthat, it means they won't compete with you.\nThat's why it's also not dangerous to tell people your idea. The truly good ideas don't sound like they're worth stealing.\nYou want an idea where you can say, \"I know it sounds like a bad idea, but here's specifically why it's actually a great\none.\" You want to sound crazy, but you want to actually be right. And you want an idea that not many other people are\nworking on. And it's okay if it doesn't sound big at first.\nA common mistake among founders, especially first time founders, is that they think the first version of their product - the\nfirst version of their idea - needs to sound really big. But it doesn't. It needs to take over a small specific market and\nexpand from there. That's how most great companies get started. Unpopular but right is what you're going for. You want\nsomething that sounds like a bad idea, but is a good idea.\nYou also really want to take the time to think about how the market is going to evolve. You need a market that's going to\nbe big in 10 years. Most investors are obsessed with the market size today, and they don't think at all about how the\nmarket is going to evolve.\nIn fact, I think this is one of the biggest systemic mistakes that investors make. They think about the growth of the start-up\nitself, they don't think about the growth of the market. I care much more about the growth rate of the market than its current\nsize, and I also care if there's any reason it's going to top out. You should think about this. I prefer to invest in a company\nthat's going after a small, but rapidly growing market, than a big, but slow-growing market.\nOne of the big advantages of these sorts of markets - these smaller, rapidly growing markets - is that customers are\nusually pretty desperate for a solution, and they'll put up with an imperfect, but rapidly improving product. A big advantage\nof being a student - one of the two biggest advantages - is that you probably have better intuition about which markets are\nlikely to start growing rapidly than older people do. Another thing that students usually don't understand, or it takes\nawhile, [is that] you can not create a market that does not exist. You can basically change everything in a start-up but the\nmarket, so you should actually do some thinking to be sure - or be as sure as you can be - that the market you're going\nafter is going to grow and be there.\nThere are a lot of different ways to talk about the right kind of market. For example, surfing some one else's wave,\nstepping into an up elevator, or being part of a movement, but all of this is just a way of saying that you want a market\nthat's going to grow really quickly.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4132, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a9817b7-20f5-468d-8c7e-d0c7fc9d19a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a9817b7-20f5-468d-8c7e-d0c7fc9d19a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81230b48-0898-4543-a0ad-d641c6b23787", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6820fa6e257ab35817789a82ed8436fef66c96db70bce675882f2225dbc8a5ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c03e9b90-1930-4e04-9ecf-61459b6d1084", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "0444ef85f78a06a2b86c53583e6f38c4fa5b79e8e900b4e81d49016540d26027", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e9ca9c0-6101-4a2f-b8bc-7bd593a7093a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9f04599cb69d25c6f2c8c271dad52990078841bfac970d373344d28b31d67a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0191277accfede238e928d701d458911512b0244740363fa280913eb72d05159", "text": "A big advantage\nof being a student - one of the two biggest advantages - is that you probably have better intuition about which markets are\nlikely to start growing rapidly than older people do.

Why is this the perfect\ntime for this particular idea, and to start this particular company. Why couldn't it be done two years ago, and why will two\nyears in the future be two late? For the most successful startups we've been involved with, they've all had a great idea\nand a great answer to this question. And if you don't you should be at least somewhat suspicious about it.\nIn general, its best if you're building something that you yourself need. You'll understand it much better than if you have to\nunderstand it by talking to a customer to build the very first version. If you don't need it yourself, and you're building\nsomething someone else needs, realize that you're at a big disadvantage, and get very very close to your customers. Try\nto work in their office, if you can, and if not, talk to them multiple times a day.\nAnother somewhat counterintuitive thing about good startup ideas is that they're almost always very easy to explain and\nvery easy to understand. If it takes more then a sentence to explain what you're doing, that's almost always a sign that its\ntoo complicated. It should be a clearly articulated vision with a small number of words. And the best ideas are usually\nvery different from existing companies, [either] in one important way, like Google being a search engine that worked just\nreally well, and none of the other stuff of the portals, or totally new, like SpaceX. Any company that's a clone of something\nelse, that already exists, with some small or made up differentiator\u2014like X, beautiful design, or Y for people that like red\nwine instead\u2014that usually fails.\nSo as I mentioned, one of the great things about being a student is that you've got a very good perspective on new\ntechnology. And learning to have good ideas takes a while, so start working on that right now. That's one thing we hear\nfrom people all the time, that they wish they had done more of as a student.\nThe other is meeting potential cofounders. You have no idea how good of an environment you're in right now, for meeting\npeople you can start a company with down the road. And the one thing that we always tell college students is that more\nimportant then any particular startup is getting to know potential cofounders.\nSo I want to finish this section of my talk with a quote from 50 Cent. This is from when he was asked about Vitamin Water.\nI won't read it, it's up there, but it's about the importance of thinking about what customers want, and thinking about the\ndemands of the market. Most people don't do this\u2014most students especially don't do this. If you can just do this one thing,\nif you can just learn to think about the market first, you'll have a big leg up on most people starting startups. And this is\nprobably the thing we see wrong with Y Combinator apps most frequently, is that people have not thought about the\nmarket first, and what people want first.\nSo for the next section, I'm going to talk about building a great product. And here, again, I'm going to use a very broad\ndefinition of product. It includes customer support, the copy you write explaining the product, anything involved in your\ncustomer's interaction in what you built for them.\nTo build a really great company, you first have to turn a great idea into a great product. This is really hard, but its crucially\nimportant, and fortunately its pretty fun. Although great products are always new to the world, and its hard to give you\nadvice about what to build, there are enough commonalities that we can give you a lot of advice about how to build it.\nOne of the most important tasks for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a great product. Until you build a\ngreat product, nothing else matters. When really successful startup founders tell the story of their early days its almost\nalways sitting in front of the computer working on their product, or talking to their customers. That's pretty much all the\ntime. They do very little else, and you should be very skeptical if your time allocation is much different. Most other\nproblems that founders are trying to solve, raising money, getting more press, hiring, business development, et cetera,\nthese are significantly easier when you have a great product. Its really important to take care of that first.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4364, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "849a3d40-e123-4786-bcb6-7881d3cbafba": {"__data__": {"id_": "849a3d40-e123-4786-bcb6-7881d3cbafba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4063a29d-5727-4eaa-8622-4c6412fe9a31", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "de1ca341c1d1a2f13db7bec50fa481e4203f4d9514e5724f8b752252deb7d30e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e9ca9c0-6101-4a2f-b8bc-7bd593a7093a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a9f04599cb69d25c6f2c8c271dad52990078841bfac970d373344d28b31d67a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "85672cfa-a75b-42e7-a512-4d263e5b30f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb03b1e129a04ef4230e4dae268ebe6dedcfab174723a756abceda970fcc0b29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "da7244d356902d36d442266fcfdfc7a31277ee77d2c955dbd9bfc4c41b7d440a", "text": "Although great products are always new to the world, and its hard to give you\nadvice about what to build, there are enough commonalities that we can give you a lot of advice about how to build it.\nOne of the most important tasks for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a great product.

At YC, we tell founders to work on their product, talk to users, exercise, eat and sleep,\nand very little else. All the other stuff I just mentioned\u2014PR, conferences, recruiting advisers, doing partnerships\u2014you\nshould ignore all of that, and just build a product and get it as good as possible by talking to your users.\nYour job is to build something that users love. Very few companies that go on to be super successful get there without first\ndoing this. A lot of good-on-paper startups fail because they merely make something that people like. Making something\nthat people want, but only a medium amount, is a great way to fail, and not understand why you're failing.

Of course, it would be best to build something that a small number of users love, but opportunities to\ndo that for v1 are rare, and they're usually not available to startups. So in practice you end up choosing the gray of the\norange. You make something that a lot of users like a little bit, or something that a small number of users love a lot. This is\na very important piece of advice. Build something that a small number of users love. It is much easier to expand from\nsomething that small number of people love, to something that a lot of people love, then from something that a lot of\npeople like to a lot of people love. If you get right, you can get a lot of other things wrong. If you don't get this right, you can\nget everything else right, and you'll probably still fail. So when you start on the startup, this is the only thing you need to\ncare about until its working.\n[Audience member]: Can you go over that slide again?\nSo you have a choice in a startup. The best thing of all worlds is to build a product that a lot of people really love. In\npractice, you can't usually do that, because if there's an opportunity like that, Google or Facebook will do it. So there's like\na limit to the area under the curve, of what you can build. So you can build something that a large number of users like a\nlittle bit, or a small number of users love a lot. So like the total amount of love is the same, its just a question of how its\ndistributed. [audience laughter] And there's like this law of conservation of how much happiness you can put in the world,\nwith the first product of a startup.\nAnd so startups always struggle, with which of those two they should go. And they seem equal, right? Because the area\nunder the curve is the same. But we've seen this time and again, that they're not. And that it's so much easier to expand,\nonce you've got something that some people love, you can expand that into something that a lot of other people love. But\nif you start with ambivalence, or weak enthusiasm, and try to expand that, you'll never get up to a lot of people loving it. So\nthe advice is: find a small group of users, and make them love what you're doing\nOne way that you know when this is working, is that you'll get growth by word of mouth. If you get something people love,\npeople will tell their friends about it. This works for consumer product and enterprise products as well. When people really\nlove something, they'll tell their friends about it, and you'll see organic growth.\nIf you find yourself talking about how it's okay that you're not growing\u2014because there's a big partnership that's going to\ncome save you or something like that\u2014its almost always a sign of real trouble. Sales and marketing are really important,\nand we're going to have two classes on them later. A great product is the secret to long term growth hacking. You should\nget that right before anything else. It doesn't get easier to put off making a great product. If you try to build a growth\nmachine before you have a product that some people really love, you're almost certainly going to waste your time.\nBreakout companies almost always have a product that's so good, it grows by word of mouth. Over the long run, great\nproduct win. Don't worry about your competitors raising a lot of money, or what they might do in the future. They probably\naren't very good anyway. Very few startups die from competition. Most die because they themselves fail to make\nsomething users love, they spend their time on other things. So worry about this about all else.\nAnother piece of advice to make something that users love: start with something simple. Its much much easier to make a\ngreat product if you have something simple. Even if your eventual plans are super complex, and hopefully they are, you\ncan almost always start with a smaller subset of the problem then you think is the smallest, and its hard to build a great\nproduct, so you want to start with as little surface area as possible.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4134, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a8e943f-0736-40fb-a8f8-9b0ee4049dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a8e943f-0736-40fb-a8f8-9b0ee4049dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16d1a563-1086-4720-bddc-05ca08a6eada", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e1f40bb2c9fbda6e09dae1aad7655fa0aeef7bd78be043c12481eaee9616ad55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85672cfa-a75b-42e7-a512-4d263e5b30f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "eb03b1e129a04ef4230e4dae268ebe6dedcfab174723a756abceda970fcc0b29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44609f17-7bbd-4f9a-991e-e6b566564077", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eab4ef4d59a9c6b151f8ae82cc417733f603ed63406ef91214dea429c3ee789b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1d5a74c14cbecb79b2e0c64e90b2e938f625a0e561cb57cc58b6133410e2ce1c", "text": "Breakout companies almost always have a product that's so good, it grows by word of mouth.

Think about the really successful companies, and what\nthey started with, think about products you really love. They're generally incredibly simple to use, and especially to get\nstarted using. The first version of Facebook was almost comically simple. The first version of Google was just a webpage\nwith a textbox and two buttons; but it returned the best results, and that's why users loved it. The iPhone is far simpler to\nuse then any smartphone that ever came before it, and it was the first one users really loved.\nAnother reason that simple's good is because it forces you to do one thing extremely well and you have to do that to\nmake something that people love.\nThe word fanatical comes up again and again when you listen to successful founders talk about how they think about", "start_char_idx": 3256, "end_char_idx": 4918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44609f17-7bbd-4f9a-991e-e6b566564077": {"__data__": {"id_": "44609f17-7bbd-4f9a-991e-e6b566564077", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79b8f510-2721-4800-9382-0c8fc3f48e3b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "c52e8d6715f7552ed303d737c07277d614578d09975aee643c7611936a5f12f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a8e943f-0736-40fb-a8f8-9b0ee4049dbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1d5a74c14cbecb79b2e0c64e90b2e938f625a0e561cb57cc58b6133410e2ce1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77165cb1-e2b6-446a-9aa8-de2de3521283", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ca148a44112a3b875c5cb72f2d9e3b63bd4495e9261222e46f26f8d6f82d393", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eab4ef4d59a9c6b151f8ae82cc417733f603ed63406ef91214dea429c3ee789b", "text": "their product. Founders talk about being fanatical in how they care about the quality of the small details. Fanatical in\ngetting the copy that they use to explain the product just right. and fanatical in the way that they think about customer\nsupport. In fact, one thing that correlates with success among the YC companies is the founders that hook up Pagerduty\nto their ticketing system, so that even if the user emails in the middle of the night when the founder's asleep, they still get a\nresponse within an hour. Companies actually do this in the early days. Their founders feel physical pain when the\nproduct sucks and they want to wake up and fix it. They don't ship crap, and if they do, they fix it very very quickly. And it\ndefinitely takes some level of fanaticism to build great products.\nYou need some users to help with the feedback cycle, but the way you should get those users is manually\u2014you should\ngo recruit them by hand. Don't do things like buy Google ads in the early days, to get initial users. You don't need very\nmany, you just need ones that will give you feedback everyday, and eventually love your product. So instead of trying to\nget them on Google Adwords, just the few people, in the world, that would be good users. Recruit them by hand.\nBen Silbermann, when everyone thought Pinterest was a joke, recruited the initial Pinterest users by chatting up\nstrangers in coffee shops. He really did, he just walked around Palo Alto and said \"Will you please use my product?\" He\nalso used to run around the Apple store in Palo Alto, and he would like set all the browsers to the Pinterest homepage\nreal quick, before they caught him and kicked him out, (laughter) and so that when people walked in they were like \"Oh,\nwhat's this?\". This is an important example of doing things that don't scale. If you haven't read Paul Graham's essay on\nthat topic, you definitely should.\nSo get users manually and remember that the goal is to get a small group of them to love you. Understand that group\nextremely well, get extremely close to them. Listen to them and you'll almost always find out that they're very willing to\ngive you feedback. Even if you're building the product for yourself, listen to outside users, and they'll tell you how to make\na product they'll pay for. Do whatever you need to make them love you, and make them know what you're doing. Because\nthey'll also be the advocates that help you get your next users.\nYou want to build an engine in the company that transforms feedback from users into product decisions. Then get it back\nin from of the users and repeat. Ask them what the like and don't like, and watch them use it. Ask them what they'd pay for.\nAsk them if they'd be really bummed if your company went away. Ask them what would make them recommend the\nproduct to their friends, and ask them if they'd recommended it to any yet.\nYou should make this feedback loop as tight as possible. If your product gets 10 percent better every week, that\ncompounds really quickly. One of the advantages of software startups is just how short you can make the feedback loop.\nIt can be measured in hours, and the best companies usually have the tightest feedback loop. You should try to keep this\ngoing for all of your company's life, but its really important in the early days.\nThe good news is that all this is doable. Its hard, it takes a lot of effort, but there's no magic. The plan is at least is\nstraightforward, and you will eventually get to a great product.\nGreat founders don't put anyone between themselves and their users. The founders of these companies do things like\nsales and customer support themselves in the early days. Its critical to get this loop embedded in the culture. In fact, a\nspecific problem we always see with Stanford startups, for some reason, is that the students try to hire sales and customer\nsupport people right away, and you've got to do this yourself, its the only way.\nYou really need to use metrics to keep yourself honest on this.

On the positive side, this is one of the most fun parts of building a startup.\nSo I'm going to pause here, we'll pick back up with the rest of this on Thursday, and now Dustin is going to talk about why", "start_char_idx": 3198, "end_char_idx": 4964, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e94e3b7-b3ac-41d7-8f23-8d552bad8c84": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e94e3b7-b3ac-41d7-8f23-8d552bad8c84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "617e3db2-0148-4e73-8153-9a04dc2ccd3d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "235bb643f011f03a91e2b2ae61adaf10e1603854b48de68f6b8d0f5b06b28a36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77165cb1-e2b6-446a-9aa8-de2de3521283", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "3ca148a44112a3b875c5cb72f2d9e3b63bd4495e9261222e46f26f8d6f82d393", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9adca20d-687b-4f5d-880e-76472ddfa50b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02cdf27ddfd176064cbb2d14a71baec4bbc347f2d6eafb97dca5cdd375ad6a6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "565c9dd7c2d27142a601d70772cd54a9d957508b78e535b55742f3f4da0cd5a0", "text": "you should start a startup. Thank you for coming, Dustin.\nWhy To Start A Startup\nBut yeah, Sam asked me to talk about why you should start a startup. There's a bunch of common reasons that people\nhave, that I hear all the time for why you might start a startup. Its important to know what reason is yours, because some of\nthem only make sense in certain contexts, some of them will actually, like, lead you astray. You may have been mislead\nby the way that Hollywood or the press likes to romanticize entrepreneurship, so I want to try to illuminate some of those\npotential fallacies, so you guys can make the decision in a clear way. And then I'll talk about the reason I like best for\nactually starting a startup, its very related to a lot of what Sam just talked about. But surprisingly, I don't think its the most\ncommon reason. Usually people have one of these other reasons, or, you know, they just want to start a company for the\nsake of starting a company.\nSo the 4 common reasons, just to enumerate them, are it's glamorous, you'll get to be the boss, you'll have flexibility,\nespecially over your schedule, and you'll have the chance to have bigger impact and make more money then you might\nby joining a later stage company.\nSo you guys are probably pretty familiar this concept, when I wrote the Medium post, which a lot of you guys read a year\nago, I felt like the story in the press was a little more unbalanced, entrepreneurship got romanticized quite a bit. The\nmovie The Social Network came out, it had a lot of like bad aspects of what it like to be an entrepreneur, but mainly it\npainted this picture of like, there's a lot of partying and you just kind of move from like one brilliant insight to another\nbrilliant insight, and really made it seem like this really cool thing to do.\nAnd I think the reality is just not quite so glamorous, there's an ugly side to being an entrepreneur, and more importantly,\nwhat you're actually spending your time on is just a lot of hard work. Sam mentioned this, but your basically just sitting at\nyour desk, heads down, focused, answering customer support emails, doing sales, figuring out hard engineering\nproblems. So its really important that you go in with eyes wide open. And then its also quite stressful. This has been a\npopular topic in the press lately: The Economist actually ran a story just last week called \"Entreupeneurs anonymous\",\nand shows a founder like hiding under his desk, talking about founder depression. So this is a very real thing. Let's be\nreal, if you start a company its going to be extremely hard.\nWhy is it so stressful? So a couple reasons. One is you've got a lot of responsibility. People in any career have a fear of\nfailure, its kind of just like a dominant part of the part of the psychology. But when you're an entrepreneur, you have fear of\nfailure on behalf of yourself and all of the people who decided to follow you. So that's really stressful. In some cases\npeople are depending on you for their livelihood, even when that's not true, they've decided to devote the best years of\ntheir life to following you. So you're responsible for the opportunity cost of their time. You're always on call, if something\ncomes up\u2014maybe not always at 3 in the morning, but for some startups that's true\u2014but if something important comes up,\nyou're going to deal with it. That's kinda the end of the story, doesn't matter if you're on vacation, doesn't matter if its the\nweekend, you've got to always be on the ball and be in a place mentally where you're prepared to deal with those things.\nA sort of special example of this kind of stress is fundraising.\nSo a scene from The Social Network. This is us partying and working at the same time\u2014somebody's spraying\nchampagne everywhere\u2014The Social Network spends a lot of time painting these scenes. Mark's not in the scene, the\nother thing they spend all their time on is painting him out to be a huge jerk.\nThis is an actual scene from Palo Alto, he spent a lot of time at this desk, head down and focused. Mark was still kinda a\njerk sometimes, but in this more like fun lovable way, and not in a sociopathic, scorned lover way.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9adca20d-687b-4f5d-880e-76472ddfa50b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9adca20d-687b-4f5d-880e-76472ddfa50b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "617e3db2-0148-4e73-8153-9a04dc2ccd3d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "235bb643f011f03a91e2b2ae61adaf10e1603854b48de68f6b8d0f5b06b28a36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e94e3b7-b3ac-41d7-8f23-8d552bad8c84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "565c9dd7c2d27142a601d70772cd54a9d957508b78e535b55742f3f4da0cd5a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1d52f02-3b28-41fa-8d44-ad8584b37f4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "81128a453b5be5405ce9c6b06fad291b59408dfc0d76026073a6efaf9d2c5eb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "02cdf27ddfd176064cbb2d14a71baec4bbc347f2d6eafb97dca5cdd375ad6a6b", "text": "That's kinda the end of the story, doesn't matter if you're on vacation, doesn't matter if its the\nweekend, you've got to always be on the ball and be in a place mentally where you're prepared to deal with those things.\nA sort of special example of this kind of stress is fundraising.\nSo a scene from The Social Network.

So they like to paint that scene and jump to these moments from other moments, with partying in between. But\nreally we were just at that table the whole time. So if you compare this photo, Mark is in the exact same position but he's\nwearing different clothes, so this is definitely a different day. That's what it's actually like in person.

So part of it being glamorous is you get some positive media\nattention sometimes, it's nice to be on the cover of Time and to be the Person of the Year. It's maybe a little less nice to be\non the cover of People with one of your wedding photos. It depends on who you are, I really hate it, but when Valleywag\nanalyzes your lecture and tears you apart, you don't want that, you definitely don't want that. Nobody wants that.\nOne thing I almost never hear people talk about is you're much more committed. So if you're at a startup and it's very\nstressful and things are not going well, you're unhappy, you can just leave. For a founder, you can leave, but it's very\nuncool and pretty much a black eye for the rest of your career. And so you really are committed for ten years if it's going\nwell and probably more like five years if it's not going well. So three years to figure out it's not going well and then if you\nfind a nice landing for your company, another two years at the acquiring company. If you leave before that, again it's not\nonly going to harm yourself financially but it's going to harm all your employees. So if you're lucky and you have a bad\nstartup idea, you fail quickly, but most of the time it's not like that.\nI should say, I've had a lot of this stress in my own life, especially in the early years of Facebook, I got really unhealthy, I\nwasn't exercising, I had a lot of anxiety actually throughout my back, like almost every six months, when I was twenty-one\nor twenty-two, which is pretty crazy. So if you do start a company, be aware that you're going to deal with this. You're\ngoing to have to actually manage this, it's one of your core responsibilities. Ben Horowitz likes to say the number one role\nof a CEO is managing your own psychology, it's absolutely true, make sure you do it.\nAnother reason, especially if you're had another job at another company, you start to develop this narrative, like the\npeople running this company are idiots, they're making all these decisions and spending all their time in these stupid\nways, I'm gonna start a company and I'm going to do it better. I'm going to set all the rules.\nSounds good, makes a lot of sense. If you've read my media post, you'll know what's coming, I'll give you guys a second\nto read this quote:\nPeople have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started and being on top of the pyramid. Some people\nare motivated by that, but that\u2019s not at all what it\u2019s like.\nWhat it\u2019s really like: everyone else is your boss \u2013 all of your employees, customers, partners, users, media are your\nboss. I\u2019ve never had more bosses and needed to account for more people today.\nThe life of most CEOs is reporting to everyone else, at least that\u2019s what it feels like to me and most CEOs I know. If\nyou want to exercise power and authority over people, join the military or go into politics. Don\u2019t be an entrepreneur.\n-Phil Libin\nThis really resonates with me. One thing to point out is that the reality of these decision is nuanced. The people you\nthought were idiots probably weren't idiots, they just had a really difficult decision in front of them and people pulling them\nin multiple directions. So the most common thing I have to spend my time on and my energy on as a CEO is dealing with\nthe problems that other people are bringing to me, the other priorities that people create, and it's usually in the form of a\nconflict. People want to go in different directions or customers want different things. And I might have my own opinions on\nthat, but the game I'm playing is who do I disappoint the least and just trying to navigate all these difficult situations.\nAnd even on a day to day basis, I might come in on Monday and have all these grand plans for how I'm going to improve\nthe company. But if an important employee is threatening to quit, that's my number one priority. That's what I'm spending\nmy time on.\nA subset of You're the Boss is you have flexibility, you have control over your own schedule. This is a really attractive\nidea. So here's the reality:\nIf you're going to be an entrepreneur, you will actually get some flex time to be honest. You'll be able to work any\n24 hours a day you want!\n-Phil Libin", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3325c06-a030-4505-a188-2f361860158b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3325c06-a030-4505-a188-2f361860158b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dacd51ef-c84d-4b41-b45c-0bd30f232fa7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d0671c3476b0ef2bae0cd346efffb175a5b098f22993216afdd237c83092a7b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1d52f02-3b28-41fa-8d44-ad8584b37f4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "81128a453b5be5405ce9c6b06fad291b59408dfc0d76026073a6efaf9d2c5eb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5425e416-1e9a-42af-9530-2748711eeb09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "07244ec336b7018e5952852acb9df1a5fa12252ed94f956cc3d04be580e7a976", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9a317b7ef2ccb5b491e0c78e965e7dd70a1c5562794fa791ed64ad0667db1b1b", "text": "This truly resonates with me as well. Some of the reasons for this again, you're always on call. So maybe you don't intend\nto work all parts of the day, but you don't control which ones.\nYou're a role model of the company, and this is super important. So if you're an employee at a company, you might have\nsome good weeks and you might have some bad weeks, some weeks when you're low energy and you might want to\ntake a couple days off. That's really bad if you're an entrepreneur. Your team will really signal off of what you're bringing\nto the table. So if you take your foot off the gas, so will they.\nYou're always working anyways. If you're really passionate about an idea, it's going to pull you towards it. If you're\nworking with great investors, you're working with great partners, they're going to be working really hard, they're going to\nwant you to be working really hard.\nSome companies like to tell the story about you can have your cake and eat it too, you can have like 4 days work weeks\nmaybe, if you're Tim Ferris maybe you can have a 12 hours work week. It's a really attractive idea and it does work in a\nparticular instance which is if you wanna actually have a small business to go after in each market then you are a small\nbusiness entrepreneur, that makes little sense but as soon as you get past like 2 or 3 people you really need to step it up\nand be full-time committed.\nYou'll make more money and have more impact\nThis is the big one, the one I hear the most especially like candidates applying to Asana, they tell me \"You know I'd really\nlike to work for much smaller companies or start my own because then I have a much bigger slice of the pie or have much\nmore impact on how that company does and I'll have more equity so I'll make more money as well\". So let's examine\nwhen this might be true.\nI'll explain these tables. They're a little complex but let's focus on the left first. These are just explaining Dropbox and\nFacebook, these are their current valuations and this is how much money you might make as employee number 100\ncoming into these companies especially if you're like an experienced, relatively experienced engineer, you have like 5\nyears of industry experience, you're pretty likely to have an offer that's around 10 base points. If you joined Dropbox\ncouple years ago the upside you've already locked in is about $10M and there's plenty more growth from there. If you\njoined Facebook a couple years into its existence you've already made around $200M, this is a huge number and even if\nyou joined Facebook as employee number 1000, so you joined like 2009, you still make $20M, that's a giant number and\nthat's how you should be benchmarking when you're thinking about what you might make as an entrepreneur.\nMoving over to the table on the right, these are two theoretical companies you might start. \"Uber for Pet Sitting\", pretty\ngood idea if you're really well suited to this you might have a really good shot at building a $100M company and your\nshare of that company is likely to be around 10%; that certainly fluctuates a lot, some founders have more than this, some\nfounders have a lot less, but after multiple rounds of dilution, multiple rounds of option pool creation you're pretty likely to\nend up about here. If you have more than this I'd recommend Sam's post on equity split between founders and\nemployees, you should be probably giving out more.\nSo basically if you're extremely confident in building a $100M, which is a big ask, it should go without saying that you\nshould have a lot more confidence on Facebook in 2009 or Dropbox in 2014 that you might for a startup that doesn't even\nexist yet, then this is worth doing.

And you get to work with a team, it'll help you leverage your ideas into something great.\nSo couple specific examples, Bret Taylor came into Google as around employee number 1500 and he invented Google\nMaps, that's a product you guys probably use everyday, I used it to get here and it's used by hundreds of millions of\npeople around the world. He didn't need to start a company to do that, he happened to get a big financial reward, but the\npoint is yet again massive impact.\nMy cofounder Justin Rosenstein joined Google a little later after Brett, he was a PM there and just as a side project he\nended up prototyping a chat which used to be a stand-alone app, integrated in Gmail like you see in the upper right there\nand before he did that like you couldn't even think you could chat over Ajax or chat in the browser at all and he just kinda\ndemonstrated it and showed it to his team and made it happen. This is probably a product most of you use almost\neveryday.\nPerhaps even more impressively, shortly after that Justin left and became employee around 250 at Facebook and he led\na hackaton project along with people like Andrew Bosworth and [?] to create the Like button, this is one of the most\npopular elements anywhere on the web, totally changed how people use it and then again didn't need to start a company\nto do it and almost certainly would have failed if he had tried because he really needed the distribution of Facebook to\nmake it work.\nSo important to keep in mind the context for what kind of company you're trying to start and like where you will actually be\nable to make it happen.\nSo what's the best reason?\nSam already talked about this a little bit, but basically you can't not do it. You're super passionate about this idea, you're\nthe right person to do it, you've gotta make it happen. So how does this break down?\nThis is a wordplay, you can't not do it in two ways. One is you're so passionate about it that you have to do it and you're\ngoing to do it anyways. This is really important because you'll need that passion to get through all of those hard parts of\nbeing an entrepreneur that we talked about earlier. You'll also need it to effectively recruit, candidates can smell when\nyou don't have passion and there are enough entrepreneurs out there that do have passion so they may as well work for\none of those! So this is table stakes for being an entrepreneur. Your subconscious can also tell when you don't have\npassion and that can be a huge problem.\nThe other way to interpret this is the world needs you to do it. This is validation that the idea is important, that it's going to\nmake the world better, so the world needs it. If it's not something the world needs, go do something the world needs. Your\ntime is really valuable, there are plenty of good ideas out there, maybe it's not your own, maybe it's at an existing\ncompany, but you may as well work on something that's going to be good.\nThe second way to interpret this is that the world needs you to do it. You're actually well suited for this problem in some\nway. If this isn't true, it may be a sign that your time is better spent somewhere else. But best case scenario if this isn't true,\nyou outcompete the team for which it is true and it's a suboptimal outcome for the world and that doesn't feel very good.\nSo drawing this back to my own experience at Asana, Justin and I were reluctant entrepreneurs before we founded\nAsana, we were working at Facebook and we were working on a great problem.

So, if you have a question about what we covered last time, I am welcome to answer it now,\nstarting with you.\nQ: How do I identify if a market has a fast growth rate now and also for the next ten years?\nA: The good news about this is this is one of the big advantages students have. You should just trust your instincts on this.\nOlder people have to basically guess about the technologies young people are using. But you can just watch what you're\ndoing and what your friends are doing and you will almost certainly have better instincts than anybody older than you.\nAnd so the answer to this is just trust your instincts, think about what you're doing more, think about what you're using,\nwhat you're seeing people your age using, that will almost certainly be the future.\nOkay, one more question on the last lecture before we start.\nQ: How do you deal with burnout while still being productive and remaining productive.\nA: The answer to this is just that it sucks and you keep going. Unlike a student where you can throw up your hands and\nsay you know I'm really burnt out and I'm just going to get bad grades this quarter, one of the hard parts about running a\nstartup is that it's real life and you just have to get through it. The canonical advice is to go on a vacation and that never\nworks for founders. It's sort of all consuming in this way that is very difficult to understand.\nSo what you do is you just keep going. You rely on people, it's really important, founder depression is a serious thing and\nyou need to have a support network. But the way through burn out is just to address the challenges, to address the things\nthat are going wrong and you'll eventually feel better.\nLast lecture, we covered the idea and the product and I want to emphasize that if you don't get those right, none of the\nrest of this is going to save you. Today, we're going to talk about how to hire and how to execute. Hopefully you don't\nexecute the people you hire. Sometimes.\nFirst, I want to talk about cofounders. Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company.\nEveryone says you have to watch out for tension brewing among cofounders and you have to address is immediately.\nThat's all true and certainly in YC's case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. But for\nsome reason, a lot of people treat choosing their cofounder with even less importance than hiring. Don't do this! This is\none of the most important decisions you make in the life of your startup and you need to treat it as such.\nAnd for some reason, students are really bad at this. They just pick someone. They're like, I want to start a business and\nyou want to start a business, let's start a startup together. There are these cofounder dating things where you're like, Hey\nI'm looking for a cofounder, we don't really know each other, let's start a company. And this is like, crazy. You would never\nhire someone like this and yet people are willing to choose their business partners this way. It's really really bad. And\nchoosing a random random cofounder, or choosing someone you don't have a long history with, choosing someone\nyou're not friends with, so when things are really going wrong, you have this sort of past history to bind you together,\nusually ends up in disaster.\nWe had one YC batch in which nine out of about seventy-five companies added on a new cofounder between when we\ninterviewed the companies and when they started, and all nine of those teams fell apart within the next year. The track\nrecord for companies where the cofounders don't know each other is really bad.\nA good way to meet a cofounder is to meet in college. If you're not in college and you don't know a cofounder, the next\nLecture 2: Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part II\nSam Altman", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3949, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e51e9a7-44b1-4f36-aac2-2af6aa3fcd1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e51e9a7-44b1-4f36-aac2-2af6aa3fcd1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21ce9084-0ca7-4d86-9609-c47fea486dee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "70c0645c381991a84700a664d5b7867ac22bd75e5dddbe9fab0e59471b5e7325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "433387b3-3045-4ef6-a3ae-f0338167b67a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "8580bf85c967aca7b144bf224afeec3ad0bb1eeb2055c7d87a157c7c0c960958", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5904570-44d1-4b93-8585-c301ab6a192d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67e981cf10370ad7f9e68a11dac49fef487408c7dfd1def755bd71d685130df3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7e87f8c5a1d3cb0b329636a36a14f1eca950f2a279f4d6fb57006ed51f45a4b3", "text": "best thing I think is to go work at an interesting company. If you work at Facebook or Google or something like that, it's\nalmost as cofounder rich as Stanford. It's better to have no cofounder than to have a bad cofounder, but it's still bad to be\na solo founder. I was just looking at the stats here before we started. For the top, and I may have missed one because I\nwas counting quickly, but I think, for the top twenty most valuable YC companies, almost all of them have at least two\nfounders. And we probably funded a rate of like one out of ten solo teams.\nSo, best of all, cofounder you know, not as good as that, but still okay, solo founder. Random founder you meet, and yet\nstudents do this for some reason, really really bad.\nSo as you're thinking about cofounders and people that could be good, there's a question of what you're looking for right?\nAt YC we have this public phrase, and it's relentlessly resourceful, and everyone's heard of it. And you definitely need\nrelentlessly resourceful cofounders, but there's a more colorful example that we share at the YC kickoff. Paul Graham\nstarted using this and I've kept it going.\nSo, you're looking for cofounders that need to be unflappable, tough, they know what to do in every situation. They act\nquickly, they're decisive, they're creative, they're ready for anything, and it turns out that there's a model for this in pop\nculture. And it sounds very dumb, but it's at least very memorable and we've told every class of YC this for a long time and\nI think it helps them.\nAnd that model is James Bond. And again, this sounds crazy, but it will at least stick in your memory and you need\nsomeone that behaves like James Bond more than you need someone that is an expert in some particular domain.\nAs I mentioned earlier, you really want to know your cofounders for awhile, ideally years. This is especially true for early\nhires as well, but incidentally, more people get this right for early hires than they do for cofounders. So, take advantage of\nschool. In addition to relentlessly resourceful, you want a tough and a calm cofounder. There are obvious things like\nsmart, but everyone knows you want a smart cofounder, they don't prioritize things like tough and calm enough,\nespecially if you feel like you yourself aren't, you need a cofounder who is. If you aren't technical, and even if most of the\npeople in this room feel like they are, you want a technical cofounder. There's this weird thing going on in startups right\nnow where it's become popular to say, You know what, we don't need a technical cofounders, we're gonna hire people,\nwe're just gonna be great managers.\nThat doesn't work too well in our experience. Software people should really be starting software companies. Media\npeople should be starting media companies. In the YC experience, two or three cofounders seems to be about perfect.\nOne, obviously not great, five, really bad. Four works sometimes, but two or three I think is the target.\nThe second part of how to hire: try not to. One of the weird things you'll notice as you start a company, is that everyone will\nask you how many employees you have. And this is the metric people use to judge how real your startup is and how cool\nyou are. And if you say you have a high number of employees, they're really impressed. And if you say you have a low\nnumber of employees, then you sound like this little joke. But actually it sucks to have a lot of employees, and you should\nbe proud of how few employees you have. Lots of employees ends up with things like a high burn rate, meaning you're\nlosing a lot of money every month, complexity, slow decision making, the list goes on and it's nothing good.\nSo you want to be proud of how much you can get done with a small numbers of employees. Many of the best YC\ncompanies have had a phenomenally small number of employees for their first year, sometimes none besides the\nfounders. They really try to stay small as long as they possibly can.

And it sounds like a crazy thing to ask, but he's gotten this culture of extremely dedicated\npeople that come together when the company faces a crisis. And when the company faced a big crisis early on, everyone\nlived in the office, and they shipped product every day until the crisis was over. One of the remarkable observations about\nAirbnb is that if you talk to any of the first forty or so employees, they all feel like they were a part of the founding of the\ncompany.\nBut by having an extremely high bar, by hiring slowly ensures that everyone believes in the mission, you can get that. So\nlet's say, you listened to the warning about not hiring unless you absolutely have too. When you're in this hiring mode, it\nshould be your number one priority to get the best people. Just like when you're in product mode that should be your\nnumber one priority. And when you're in fundraising mode, fundraising is your number one priority.\nOn thing that founders always underestimate is how hard it is to recruit. You think you have this great idea and everyone's\ngoing to join. But that's not how it works. To get the very best people, they have a lot of great options and so it can easily\ntake a year to recruit someone. It's this long process and so you have to convince them that your mission is the most\nimportant of anything that they're looking at. This is another case of why it's really important to get the product right before\nlooking at anything else. The best people know that they should join a rocketship.\nBy the way, that's my number one piece of advice if you're going to join a startup, is pick a rocketship. Pick a company\nthat's already working and that not everyone yet realizes that, but you know because you're paying attention, that it's\ngoing to be huge. And again, you can usually identify these. But good people know this, and so good people will wait, to\nsee that you're on this trajectory before they join.\nOne question that people asked online this morning was how much time you should be spending on hiring. The answer\nis zero or twenty-five percent. You're either not hiring at all or it's probably your single biggest block of time. In practice, all\nthese books on management say you should spend fifty percent of your time hiring, but the people that give that advice,\nit's rare for them to even spend ten percent themselves. Twenty-five percent is still a huge amount of time, but that's really\nhow much you should be doing once you're in hiring mode.\nIf you compromise and hire someone mediocre you will always regret it. We like to warn founders of this but no one really\nfeels it until they make the mistake the first time, but it can poison the culture. Mediocre people at huge companies will\ncause some problems, but it won't kill the company. A single mediocre hire within the first five will often in fact kill a\nstartup.\nA friend of mine has a sign up in the conference room that he uses for interviews and he positions the sign that the\ncandidate is looking at it during the interview and it says that mediocre engineers do not build great companies. Yeah\nthat's true, it\u2019s really true. You can get away with it in a big company because people just sort of fall through the cracks but\nevery person at a startup sets the tone. So if you compromise in the first five, ten hires it might kill the company. And you\ncan think about that for everyone you hire: will I bet the future of this company on this single hire? And that's a tough bar.\nAt some point in the company, when you're bigger, you will compromise on a hire. There will be some pressing deadline\nor something like that you will still regret. But this is the difference between theory and practice we're going to have later\nspeakers talk about what to do when this happens.

The best source for hiring by far is people that\nyou already know and people that other employees in the company already know.

Most founders feel awkward but\ncalling anyone good that they've ever met and asking their employees to do the same.

The short version here is\nthat experience matters for some roles and not for others. When you're hiring someone that is going to run a large part of\nyour organization experience probably matters a lot. For most of the early hires that you make at a startup, experience\nprobably doesn't matter that much and you should go for aptitude and belief in what you\u2019re doing. Most of the best hires\nthat I've made in my entire life have never done that thing before. So it's really worth thinking, is this a role where I care\nabout experience or not. And you'll often find to don\u2019t, especially in the early days.\nThere are three things I look for in a hire. Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time\naround them? And if I get an answer, if I can say yes to all three of these, I never regret it, it's almost always worked out.\nYou can learn a lot about all three of these things in an interview but the very best way is working together, so ideally\nsomeone you've worked together with in the past and in that case you probably don't even need an interview. If you\nhaven't, then I think it's way better to work with someone on a project for a day or two before hiring them. You'll both learn\na lot they will too and most first-time founders are very bad interviewers but very good at evaluating someone after they've\nworked together.\nSo one of the pieces of advice that we give at YC is try to work on a project together instead of an interview. If you are\ngoing to interview, which you probably will, you should ask specifically about projects that someone worked on in the\npast. You'll learn a lot more than you will with brainteasers. For some reason, young technical cofounders love to ask\nbrainteasers rather than just ask what someone has done. Really dig in to projects people have worked on. And call\nreferences. That is another thing that first time founders like to skip. You want to call some people that these people have\nworked with in the past. And when you do, you don't just want to ask, How was so-and-so, you really want to dig in. Is this\nperson in the top five percent of people you've ever worked with? What specifically did they do? Would you hire them\nagain? Why aren't you trying to hire them again? You really have to press on these reference calls.\nAnother thing that I have noticed from talking to YC companies is that good communication skills tend to correlate with\nhires that work out. I used to not pay attention to this. We\u2019re going to talk more about why communication is so important\nin an early startup. If someone is difficult to talk to, if someone cannot communicate clearly, it's a real problem in terms of\ntheir likelihood to work out. Also. for early employees you want someone that has somewhat of a risk-taking attitude. You\ngenerally get this, otherwise they wouldn't be interested in a startup, but now that startups are sort of more in fashion, you\nwant people that actually sort of like a little bit of risk. If someone is choosing between joining McKinsey or your startup it's\nvery unlikely they're going to work out at the startup.\nYou also want people who are maniacally determined and that is slightly different than having a risk tolerant attitude. So\nyou really should be looking for both. By the way, people are welcome to interrupt me with questions as stuff comes up.\nThere is a famous test from Paul Graham called the animal test. The idea here is that you should be able to describe any\nemployee as an animal at what they do. I don't think that translates out of English very well but you need unstoppable\npeople. You want people that are just going to get it done.

I think as a\nrough estimate, you should aim to give about ten percent of the company to the first ten employees.\nThey have to earn it over four years anyway, and if they're successful, they're going to contribute way more than that.\nThey're going to increase the value of the company way more than that, and if they don't then they won't be around\nanyway.", "start_char_idx": 3421, "end_char_idx": 4951, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b0d795b-998b-48f8-acd4-b164d6f92432": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b0d795b-998b-48f8-acd4-b164d6f92432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa0bfd9-043a-452a-bdfc-f44fbd6e510b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "f5fb1c3aa1d34d2bd027f0d97b4f48b4fdb48a6edefd5ef148eca651047ca417", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d329076a-691e-45a6-b51e-136e9c0cfd23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6137e08e35f02ccaf8c9f71fa74415c2a33ccf766428cbc4cade41b86399a755", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8c6c1a9-a0f4-4bb0-b9b7-ac734370f279", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "441f7581d54a6b5025fb04be35b46dbfe46296889ff62216230a830f69101d36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aa826e82b2a065f5cb8aca12efe1d4cea7a0e0b0f72b928a46ca1d467c764258", "text": "For whatever reason founders are usually very stingy with equity to employees and very generous with equity for\ninvestors. I think this is totally backwards. I think this is one of the things founders screw up the most often. Employees will\nonly add more value over time. Investors will usually write the check and then, despite a lot of promises, don't usually do\nthat much. Sometimes they do, but your employees are really the ones that build the company over years and years.\nSo I believe in fighting with investors to reduce the amount of equity they get and then being as generous as you possibly\ncan with employees. The YC companies that have done this well, the YC companies that have been super generous with\ntheir equity to early employees, in general, are the most successful ones that we've funded.\nOne thing that founders forget is that after they hire employees, they have to retain them. I'm not going to go into full detail\nhere because we're going to have a lecture on this later, but I do want to talk about it a little bit because founders get this\nwrong so often. You have to make sure your employees are happy and feel valued. This is one of the reasons that equity\ngrants are so important. People in the excitement of joining a startup don't think about it much, but as they come in day\nafter day, year after year, if they feel they have been treated unfairly that will really start to grate on them and resentment\nwill build.\nBut more than that, learning just a little bit of management skills, which first-time CEOs are usually terrible at, goes a long\nway. One of the speakers at YC this summer, who is now extremely successful, struggled early on and had his team turn\nover a few times. Someone asked him what his biggest struggle was and he said, turns out you shouldn't tell your\nemployees they're fucking up every day unless you want them all to leave because they will.\nBut as a founder, this is a very natural instinct. You think you can do everything the best and it\u2019s easy to tell people when\nthey\u2019re not doing it well. So learning just a little bit here will prevent this massive team churn. It also doesn't come\nnaturally to most founders to really praise their team. It took me a little while to learn this too. You have to let your team\ntake credit for all the good stuff that happens, and you take responsibility for the bad stuff.\nYou have to not micromanage. You have to continually give people small areas of responsibility. These are not the things\nthat founders think about. I think the best thing you can do as a first-time founder is to be aware that you will be a very bad\nmanager and try to overcompensate for that. Dan Pink talks about these three things that motivate people to do great\nwork: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. I never thought about that when I was running my company but I've thought about\nsince and I think that\u2019s actually right. I think it's worth trying to think about that. It also took me a while to learn to do things\nlike one on one and to give clear feedback.\nAll of these things are things first time CEO don't normally do, and maybe I can save you from not doing that.\nThe last part on the team section is about firing people when it's not working. No matter what I say here is not going to\nprevent anyone from doing it wrong and the reason that I say that is that firing people is one of the worst parts of running\na company. Actually in my own experience, I'd say it is the very worst part. Every first time founder waits too long,\neveryone hopes that an employee will turn around. But the right answer is to fire fast when it's not working. It's better for\nthe company, it's also better for the employee. But it's so painful and so awful, that everyone gets it wrong the first few\ntimes.\nIn addition to firing people who are doing bad at their job, you also wanna fire people who are a) creating office politics,\nand b) who are persistently negative. The rest of the company is always aware of employees doing things like this, and\nit's just this huge drag - it's completely toxic to the company.

It's the difference between someone making one or two mistakes and just constantly\nscrewing everything up, or causing problems, or making everyone unhappy, is painfully obvious the first time you see it.\nWhen should co-founders decide on the equity split?\nFor some reason, I've never really been sure why this is, a lot of founders, a lot of co-founders like to leave this off for a\nvery long time. You know, they'll even sign the incorporation documents in some crazy way so that they can wait to have\nthis discussion.\nThis is not a discussion that gets easier with time, you wanna set this ideally very soon after you start working together.\nAnd it should be near-equal. If you're not willing to give someone - your co-founder - you know, like an equal share of the\nequity, I think that should make you think hard about whether or not you want them as a co-founder. But in any case, you\nshould try to have the ink dry on this before the company gets too far along. Like, certainly in the first number of weeks.\nSo the question is - I said that inexperience is OK - how do you know if someone's gonna scale past, not scale up to a\nrole, as things go on and later become crippling. People that are really smart and that can learn new things can almost\nalways find a role in the company as time goes on. You may have to move them into something else, something other\nthan where they started. You know, it may be that you hire someone to lead the engineering team that over time can't\nscale as you get up to 50 people, and you give them a different role. Really good people that can almost find some great\nplace in the company, I have not seen that be a problem too often.\nSo the question is what happens when your relationship with your cofounder falls apart. We're gonna have a session on\nmechanics later on in the course, but here is the most important thing that founders screw up. Which is, every cofounder,\nyou yourself of course, has to have vesting. Basically what you're doing with cofounder vesting is you're pre-negotiating\nwhat happens if one of you leaves. And so the normal stance on this in Silicon Valley is that it takes four years, let's say\nyou split the equity fifty-fifty, is that it takes four years to earn all of that. And the clock doesn't start until one year in. So if\nyou leave after one year, you keep twenty-five percent of the equity, and if you leave after two years, fifty, and on and on\nlike that.\nIf you don't do that and if you have a huge fallout and one founder leaves early on with half the company, you have this\ndeadweight on your equity table, and it's very hard to get investors to fund you or to do anything else. So number one\npiece of advice to prevent that is to have vesting on the equity. We pretty much won't fund a company now where the\nfounders don't have vested equity because it's just that bad. The other thing that comes up in the relationship between the\ncofounders, which happens to some degree in every company, is talk about it early, don't let it sit there and fester.\nIf you have to choose between hiring a sub-optimal employee and losing your customers to a competitor, what do you\ndo? If it's going to be one of the first five employees at a company I would lose those customers. The damage that it does\nto the company- it's better to lose some customers than to kill the company. Later on, I might have a slightly different\nopinion, but it's really hard to say in the general case.\nI am going to get to that later. The question is: what about cofounders that aren't working in the same location? The\nanswer is, don't do it. I am skeptical of remote teams in general but in the early days of a startup, when communication\nand speed outweigh everything else, for some reason video conferencing calls just don't work that well. The data on this\nis look at say the 30 successful software companies of all time and try to point to a single example where the cofounders\nwere in different locations.

Whatever the founders do becomes the culture. So if you want a culture where people work hard, pay\nattention to detail, manage the customers, are frugal, you have to do it yourself. There is no other way. You cannot hire a\nCOO to do that while you go off to conferences. The company just needs to see you as this maniacal execution machine.\nAs I said in the first lecture, there\u2019s at least a hundred times more people with great ideas than people who are willing to\nput in the effort to execute them well. Ideas by themselves are not worth anything, only executing well is what adds and\ncreates value.\nA big part of execution is just putting in the effort, but there is a lot you can learn about how to be good at it. And so we\u2019re\ngoing to have three classes that just talk about this.\nThe CEO, people ask me all the time about the jobs of the CEO. There are probably more than five, here are five that\ncome up a lot in the early days. The first four everyone thinks of as CEO jobs: set the vision, raise money, evangelize the\nmission to people you\u2019re trying to recruit, executives, partners, press, everybody, hire and manage the team. But the fifth\none is setting the execution bar and this is not the one that most founders get excited about or envision themselves doing\nbut I think it is actually one of the critical CEO roles and no one but the CEO can do this.\nExecution gets divided into two key questions. One, can you figure out what to do and two, can you get it done. So I want\nto talk about two parts of getting it done, assuming that you\u2019ve already figured out what to do. And those are focus and\nintensity. So focus is critical. One of my favorite questions to ask founders about what they\u2019re spending their time and their\nmoney on. This reveals almost everything about what founders think is important.\nOne of the hardest parts about being a founder is that there are a hundred important things competing for your attention\nevery day. And you have to identify the right two or three, work on those, and then ignore, delegate, or defer the rest. And\na lot of these things that founders think are important, interviewing a lot at different law firms, going to conferences,\nrecruiting advisers, whatever, they just don\u2019t matter. What really does matter varies with time, but it\u2019s an important piece of\nadvice. You need to figure out what the one or two most important things are, and then just do those.\nAnd you can only have two or three things every day, because everything else will just come at you. There will be fires\nevery day and if you don't get good at setting what those two or three things are, you'll never be good at getting stuff done.\nThis is really hard for founders. Founders get excited about starting new things.\nUnfortunately the trick to great execution is to say no a lot. You\u2019re saying no ninety-seven times out of a hundred, and\nmost founders find they have to make a very conscious effort to do this. Most startups are nowhere near focused enough.\nThey work really hard-maybe-but they don\u2019t work really hard at the right things, so they'll still fail. One of the great and\nterrible things about starting a start up is that you get no credit for trying. You only get points when you make something\nthe market wants. So if you work really hard on the wrong things, no one will care.\nSo then there's this question of how do you figure out what to focus on each day. Each day it's really important to have\ngoals. Most good founders I know have a set of small overarching goals for the company that everybody in the company\nknows. You know it could be something like ship a product by this date, get this certain growth rate, get this engagement\nrate, hire for these key roles, those are some of them but everyone in the company can tell you each week what are our\nkey goals. And then everybody executes based off of that.\nThe founders really set the focus.

Most good founders I know have a set of small overarching goals for the company that everybody in the company\nknows. You know it could be something like ship a product by this date, get this certain growth rate, get this engagement\nrate, hire for these key roles, those are some of them but everyone in the company can tell you each week what are our\nkey goals. And then everybody executes based off of that.\nThe founders really set the focus. Whatever the founders care about, whatever the founders focus on, that's going to set\nthe goals for the whole company. The best founders repeat these goals over and over, far more often than they think they\nshould need to. They put them up on the walls they talk about them in one on ones and at all-hands meetings each week.\nAnd it keeps the company focus. One of the keys to focus, and why I said cofounders that aren't friends really struggle, is\nthat you can't be focused without good communication. Even if you have only four or five people at a company, a small\ncommunication breakdown is enough for people to be working on slightly different things. And then you lose focus and\nthe company just scrambles.\nI'm going to talk about this a little bit later, but growth and momentum are something you can never lose focus on.

Don't\nlet the company get distracted or excited about other things. A common mistake is that companies get excited by their\nown PR. It's really easy to get PR with no results and it actually feels like you're really cool. But in a year you'll have\nnothing, and at that point you won't be cool anymore, and you'll just be talking about these articles from a year ago that,\nOh you know these Stanford students start a new start up, it's going to be the next big thing and now you have nothing\nand that sucks.\nAs I mentioned already, be in the same space. I think this is pretty much a nonstarter. Remote confounding teams is just\nreally really hard. It slows down the cycle time more than anybody ever thinks it's going to.\nThe other piece besides focus for execution is intensity. Startups only work at a fairly intense level. A friend of mine says\nthe secret to start up success is extreme focus and extreme dedication. You can have a startup and one other thing, you\ncan have a family, but you probably can't have many other things. Startups are not the best choice for work life balance\nand that's sort of just the sad reality. There's a lot of great things about a startup, but this is not one of them. Startups are\nall-consuming in a way that is generally difficult to explain. You basically need to be willing to outwork your competitors.\nThe good news here is that a small amount of extra work on the right thing makes a huge difference. One example that I\nlike to give is thinking about the viral coefficient for a consumer web product. How many new users each existing user\nbrings in. If it's .99 the company will eventually flatline and die. And if it's 1.01 you'll be in this happy place of exponential\ngrowth forever.\nSo this is one concrete example of where a tiny extra bit of work is the difference between success and failure. When we\ntalk to successful founders they tell stories like this all the time. Just outworking their competitors by a little bit was what\nmade them successful.\nSo you have to be really intense. This only comes from the CEO, this only comes from the founders. One of the biggest\nadvantages that start ups have is execution speed and you have to have this relentless operating rhythm. Facebook has\nthis famous poster that says move fast and break things. But at the same time they manage to be obsessed with quality.\nAnd this is why it's hard. It's easy to move fast or be obsessed with quality, but the trick is to do both at a startup. You need\nto have a culture where the company has really high standards for everything everyone does, but you still move quickly.\nApple, Google, and Facebook have each done this extremely well. It's not about the product, it's about everything they do.\nThey move fast and they break things, they're frugal in the right places, but they care about quality everywhere. You don't\nbuy people shitty computers if you don't want them to write shitty code. You have to set a quality bar that runs through the\nentire company. Related to this is that you have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders\nspend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They're talking about you know I could do\nthis thing, or I could do that other thing, and they're going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need\nis this bias towards action.\nThe best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. But they get things done really quickly.\nEvery time you talk to the best founders they've gotten new things done.

The best founders usually respond to e-mail the most quickly, make decisions most\nquickly, they're generally quick in all of these ways. And they had this do what ever it takes attitude.\nThey also show up a lot.\nThey come to meetings, they come in, they meet us in person. One piece of advice that I have that\u2019s always worked for\nme: they get on planes in marginal situations. I\u2019ll tell a quick story here.\nWhen I was running my own company, we found out we were about to lose a deal. It was sort of this critical deal from the\nfirst big customer in the space. And it was going to go to this company that had been around for year before we were. And\nthey had this like all locked up. And we called and said \u201cwe have this better product you have to meet with us\u201d and they\nsaid \u201cwell we\u2019re signing this deal tomorrow. sorry.\u201d We drove to the airport, we got on a plane, we were at their office at\n6am the next morning. We just sat there, they told us to go away, we just kept sitting there. Finally once of the junior guys\ndecided to meet with us, after that, finally one of the senior guys decided to meet with us. They ended up ripping up the\ncontract with the other company, and we closed the deal with them about a week later. And I\u2019m sure, that had we not\ngotten on a plane, had we not shown up in person, that would not have worked out.\nAnd so, you just sort of show and and do these things, when people say get on plane in marginal situations, they actually\nmean it, but they don\u2019t mean it literally. But I actually think it\u2019s good, literal advice.\nSo I mentioned this momentum and growth earlier. Once more: the momentum and growth are the lifeblood of startups.\nThis is probably in the top three secrets of executing well. You want a company to be winning all the time. If you ever take\nyour foot off the gas pedal, things will spiral out of control, snowball downwards. A winning team feels good and keeps\nwinning. A team that hasn\u2019t won in a while gets demotivated and keeps losing. So always keep momentum, it\u2019s this prime\ndirective for managing a startup. If I can only tell founders one thing about how to run a company, it would be this.\nFor most software startups, this translates to keep growing. For hardware startups it translates to: don\u2019t let your ship dates\nslip. This is what we tell people during YC, and they usually listen and everything is good. What happens at the end of YC\nis that they get distracted on other things, and then growth slows down. And somehow, after that happens, people start\ngetting unhappy and quitting and everything falls apart. It\u2019s hard to figure out a growth engine because most companies\ngrow in new ways, but there\u2019s this thing: if you build a good product it will grow. So getting this product right at the\nbeginning is the best way not to lose momentum later.\nIf you do lose momentum, most founders try to get it back in the wrong way. They give these long speeches about vision\nfor the company and try to rally the troops with speeches. But employees in a company where momentum has sagged,\ndon\u2019t want to hear that. You have to save the vision speeches for when the company is winning. When you\u2019re not\nwinning, you just have to get momentum back in small wins. A board member of mine used to say that sales fix everything\nin a startup. And that is really true. So you figure out where you can get these small wins and you get that done. And then\nyou\u2019ll be amazed at how all the other problems in a startup disappear.\nAnother thing that you\u2019ll notice if you have momentum sag, is that everyone starts disagreeing about what to do. Fights\ncome out when a company loses momentum. And so a framework for that that I think works is that when there\u2019s\ndisagreement among the team about what to do, then you ask your users and you do whatever your users tell you. And\nyou have to remind people: \u201chey, stuff\u2019s not working right now we don\u2019t actually hate each other, we just need to get back\non track and everything will work.\u201d If you just call it out, if you just acknowledge that, you\u2019ll find that things get way better.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4100, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04ddfc2d-95fe-44f8-880b-cde5fa4078c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "04ddfc2d-95fe-44f8-880b-cde5fa4078c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03666d87-7ac8-46ee-8e5b-182ac218a56d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "f3ff3432736e597e27d5d19d7a1ce4f334504d32bd0356e2f93c2bfc9adf23b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8082703c-8e89-4f67-bcf5-bb9ea1f1efee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d9e31058150a81a3ad9f9422b744daf5c21b2b60b782ebfdfbb9aa19450656df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7b80392-c838-479d-8f6d-f3ce339847ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2b7ce797a79e100434747d79eac7c0742bd6d058a330f189d34cded447f820e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7107ed3d489516d4837cec37a7c6559cc8d50341b06a05918dd07ef0a58ca2ad", "text": "A board member of mine used to say that sales fix everything\nin a startup.

Competitors making noise in the press I think\nprobably crushes a company\u2019s momentum more often than any other external factor.\nSo here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: don\u2019t worry about a competitor at all, until they\u2019re actually beating you with a real,\nshipped product. Press releases are easier to write than code, and that is still easier than making a great product. So\nremind your company of this, and this is sort of a founder\u2019s role, is not to let the company get down because of the\ncompetitors in the press.\nThis great quote from Henry Ford that I love: \u201cThe competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but\ngoes on making his own business better all the time.\u201d\nThese are almost never the companies that put out a lot of press releases.

So even though my kids are little, my two year old today,\nwhen asked what he'll be after two, said \"a bat.\" The correct answer was three, but \"a bat\" is so much more interesting. So\neven though my kids are little, I already know what I would tell them about startups, if they were in college, so that is what\nI'm going to tell you. You're literally going to get what I would tell my own kids, since most of you are young enough to be\nmy own kids.\nStartups are very counterintuitive and I'm not sure exactly why. It could be simply because knowledge about them has not\npermeated our culture yet, but whatever the reason, this is an area where you cannot trust your intuition all the time. It's\nlike skiing in that way - any of you guys learn to ski as adults? When you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your\nfirst impulse is to lean back, just like in everything else. But lean back on the skis and you fly down the hill out of control.\nSo, as I learned, part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse. Eventually you get new habits, but in the\nbeginning there is this list of things you're trying to remember as you start down the hill: alternate feet, make s-turns, do\nnot drag the inside foot, all this stuff.\nStartups are as unnatural as skiing and there is a similar list of stuff you have to remember for startups. What I'm going to\ngive you today is the beginning of the list, the list of the counterintuitive stuff you have to remember to prevent your\nexisting instincts from leading you astray.\nThe first thing on it is the fact I just mentioned: startups are so weird that if you follow your instincts they will lead you\nastray. If you remember nothing more than that, when you're about to make a mistake, you can pause before making it.\nWhen I was running Y Combinator we used to joke that our function was to tell founders things they would ignore, and it's\nreally true. Batch after batch the YC partners warned founders about mistakes they were about to make and the founders\nignored them, and they came back a year later and said, \"I wish we'd listened.\" But that dude is in their cap table and\nthere is nothing they can do.\nQ: Why do founders persistently ignore the partner\u2019s advice?\nA: That's the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions, they seem wrong, so of course your first\nimpulse is to ignore them and, in fact, that's not just the curse of Y Combinator, but to some extent our raison d'\u00eatre. You\ndon't need people to give you advice that does not surprise you. If founders' existing intuition gave them the right\nanswers, they would not need us. That's why there are a lot of ski instructors, and not many running instructors; you don't\nsee those words together, \"running instructor,\" as much as you see \"ski instructor.\" It's because skiing is counterintuitive,\nsort of what YC is\u2014business ski instructors\u2014except you are going up slopes instead of down them, well ideally.\nYou can, however, trust your instincts about people. Your life so far hasn't been much like starting a startup, but all the\ninteractions you've had with people are just like the interactions you have with people in the business world. In fact, one\nof the big mistakes that founders make is to not trust their intuition about people enough. They meet someone, who\nseems impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings and then later when things blow up, they say, \"You know I\nknew there was something wrong about that guy, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive.\"\nLecture 3: Counterintuitive Parts of Startups, and How to\nHave Ideas\nPaul Graham", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad4eda91-2254-462a-94e3-45bf6fca84f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad4eda91-2254-462a-94e3-45bf6fca84f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9455a7fd-3fd5-4df8-befd-c10148f69b6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6aaf0dec232636971843fb8510ffda98162e4a4f7c06d76e5406423dda86697f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e036aeb-6ec1-4892-af05-afe203e5e57d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "781bf78a0242a9d92f57867b3af25ff5d37fea83165b6b244695d3745db59f78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fce86443-5935-4cc5-b0bf-522c3eb4fe3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "892fe7a6e90858cd3c54fe311f300f4acbfe46d059c41e8297bf70afd8be02c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8f2dd7ef38b6001912dc18a1946d18055edc805824756363183f7944c9481abe", "text": "There is this specific sub-case in business, especially if you come from an engineering background, as I believe you all\ndo. You think business is supposed to be this slightly distasteful thing. So when you meet people who seem smart, but\nsomehow distasteful, you think, \"Okay this must be normal for business,\" but it's not. Just pick people the way you would\npick people if you were picking friends. This is one of those rare cases where it works to be self indulgent. Work with\npeople you would generally like and respect and that you have known long enough to be sure about because there are a\nlot of people who are really good at seeming likable for a while. Just wait till your interests are opposed and then you\u2019ll\nsee.\nThe second counterintuitive point, this might come as a little bit of a disappointment, but what you need to succeed in a\nstartup is not expertise in startups. That makes this class different from most other classes you take. You take a French\nclass, at the end of it you've learned how to speech French. You do the work, you may not sound exactly like a French\nperson, but pretty close, right? This class can teach you about startups, but that is not what you need to know. What you\nneed to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in your own users.\nMark Zuckerberg did not succeed at Facebook because he was an expert in startups, he succeeded despite being a\ncomplete noob at startups; I mean Facebook was first incorporated as a Florida LLC. Even you guys know better than\nthat. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups because he understood his users very well. Most of you\ndon't know the mechanics of raising an angel round, right? If you feel bad about that, don't, because I can tell you Mark\nZuckerberg probably doesn't know the mechanics of raising an angel round either; if he was even paying attention when\nRon Conway wrote him the big check, he probably has forgotten about it by now.\nIn fact, I worry it's not merely unnecessary for people to learn in detail about the mechanics of starting a startup, but\npossibly somewhat dangerous because another characteristic mistake of young founders starting startups is to go\nthrough the motions of starting a startup. They come up with some plausible sounding idea, they raise funding to get a\nnice valuation, then the next step is they rent a nice office in SoMa and hire a bunch of their friends, until they gradually\nrealize how completely fucked they are because while imitating all the outward forms of starting a startup, they have\nneglected the one thing that is actually essential, which is to make something people want. By the way that's the only use\nof that swear word, except for the initial one, that was involuntary and I did check with Sam if it would be okay; he said he\nhad done it several times, I mean use the word.\nWe saw this happen so often, people going through the motion of starting a startup, that we made up a name for it:\n\"Playing House.\" Eventually I realized why it was happening, the reason young founders go though the motions of\nstarting a startup is because that is what they have been trained to do, their whole life, up to this point. Think about what it\ntakes to get into college: extracurricular activities? Check. Even in college classes most of the work you do is as artificial\nas running laps, and I'm not attacking the educational system for being this way, inevitably the work that you do to learn\nsomething is going to have some amount of fakeness to it. And if you measure people\u2019s performance they will inevitably\nexploit the difference to the degree that what you\u2019re measuring is largely an artifact of the fakeness.\nI confess that I did this myself in college; in fact, here is a useful tip on getting good grades. I found that in a lot of classes\nthere might only be twenty or thirty ideas that had the right shape to make good exam questions. So the way I studied for\nexams in these classes was not to master the material in the class, but to try and figure out what the exam questions\nwould be and work out the answers in advance.

I remember automata theory, there are only a few things that make sense to ask about automata theory.\nSo it's not surprising that after being effectively trained for their whole lives to play such games, young founders' first\nimpulse on starting a startup is to find out what the tricks are for this new game. What are the extracurricular activities of\nstartups, what are things I have to do? They always want to know, since apparently the measure of success for a startup\nis fundraising, another noob mistake. They always want to know, what are the tricks for convincing investors? And we\nhave to tell them the best way to convince investors is to start a startup that is actually doing well, meaning growing fast,\nand then simply tell investors so.\nThen they ask okay, so what are the tricks for growing fast, and this is exacerbated by the existence of this term, \"Growth", "start_char_idx": 3543, "end_char_idx": 5325, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18dbc2b2-c1ae-4cb6-aad6-ad3199860a1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "18dbc2b2-c1ae-4cb6-aad6-ad3199860a1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "383e315d-0715-4e1f-ad13-2451c4ca5654", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "abafcfcf487775ec346f7290584eabd0aaf4cc5432a097da721e6aba4a9bde01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fce86443-5935-4cc5-b0bf-522c3eb4fe3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "892fe7a6e90858cd3c54fe311f300f4acbfe46d059c41e8297bf70afd8be02c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49525338-2397-45ed-ab51-6fc2b6677fc8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc4fe831cd43068270303eafa785258bd196ca6f92799551e6066cd790baf01a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "74ec98f59aca5691b7a4140177efe4c1e8f196dbc59cf49e8f97ef50e861fea6", "text": "Hacks.\" Whenever you hear somebody talk about Growth Hacks, just mentally translate it in your mind to \"bullshit,\"\nbecause what we tell them is the way to make your startup grow is to make something that users really love, and then tell\nthem about it. So that's what you have to do: that's Growth Hacks right there.\nSo many of the conversations the YC partners have with the founders begin with the founders saying a sentence that\nbegins with, \"How do I,\" and the partners answering with a sentence that begins with, \"Just.\" Why do they make things so\ncomplicated? The reason, I realized, after years of being puzzled by this, is they're looking for the trick, they've been\ntrained to look for the trick.\nSo, this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops\nworking. Gaming the system may continue to work, if you go to work for a big company, depending on how broken the\ncompany is, you may be able to succeed by sucking up to the right person; Giving the impression of productivity by\nsending emails late at night, or if you're smart enough changing the clock on your computer, cause who's going to check\nthe headers, right? I like an audience I can tell jokes to and they laugh. Over in the business school: \"headers?\" Okay,\nGod this thing is being recorded, I just realized that.\nAlright for now on we are sticking strictly to the script. But, in startups, that does not work. There is no boss to trick, how\ncan you trick people, when there is nobody to trick? There are only users and all users care about is whether your\nsoftware does what they want, right? They're like sharks, sharks are too stupid to fool, you can't wave a red flag and fool it,\nit's like meat or no meat. You have to have what people want and you only prosper to the extent that you do. The\ndangerous thing is, especially for you guys, the dangerous thing is that faking does work to some extent with investors.\nIf you\u2019re really good at knowing what you\u2019re talking about, you can fool investors, for one, maybe two rounds of funding,\nbut it's not in your interest to do. I mean, you're all doing this for equity, you're puling a confidence trick on yourself.\nWasting your own time, because the startup is doomed and all you\u2019re doing is wasting your time writing it down. So, stop\nlooking for the trick. There are tricks in startups, as there are in any domain, but they are an order of magnitude less\nimportant than solving the real problem. Someone who knows zero about fundraising, but has made something users\nreally love, will have an easier time raising money than someone who knows every trick in the book, but has a flat usage\ngraph.\nThough, in a sense, it's bad news that gaming the system stops working now, in the sense that you're deprived of your\nmost powerful weapons and, after all, you spent twenty years mastering them. I find it very exciting that there even exist\nparts of the world where gaming the system is not how you win. I would have been really excited in college if I explicitly\nrealized that there are parts of the world where gaming the system matters less than others, and some where it hardly\nmatters at all. But there are, and this is one of the most important thing to think about when planning your future. How do\nyou win at each type of work, and what do you want to win by doing it?\nThat brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point, startups are all consuming. If you start a startup, it will take over your life\nto a degree that you cannot imagine and if it succeeds it will take over your life for a long time; for several years, at the\nvery least, maybe a decade, maybe the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here. It may seem to\nyou that Larry Page has an enviable life, but there are parts of it that are defiantly unenviable. The way the world looks to\nhim is that he started running as fast as he could, at age twenty-five, and he has not stopped to catch his breath since.\nEvery day shit happens within the Google empire that only the emperor can deal with and he, as the emperor, has to deal\nwith it.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4124, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49525338-2397-45ed-ab51-6fc2b6677fc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "49525338-2397-45ed-ab51-6fc2b6677fc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "383e315d-0715-4e1f-ad13-2451c4ca5654", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "abafcfcf487775ec346f7290584eabd0aaf4cc5432a097da721e6aba4a9bde01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "18dbc2b2-c1ae-4cb6-aad6-ad3199860a1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "74ec98f59aca5691b7a4140177efe4c1e8f196dbc59cf49e8f97ef50e861fea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7d6b300-15d8-4080-a5e7-704f40c083a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "504f8265fcd79698e1447aa24c5ce742c44ab8e69e9e3833d6b3c525a7732324", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bc4fe831cd43068270303eafa785258bd196ca6f92799551e6066cd790baf01a", "text": "That brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point, startups are all consuming.

If anything, it increases.\nStarting a successful startup is similar to having kids; it's like a button you press and it changes your life irrevocably. While\nit's honestly the best thing\u2014having kids\u2014if you take away one thing from this lecture, remember this: There are a lot of\nthings that are easier to do before you have kids than after, many of which will make you a better parent when you do\nhave kids. In rich countries, most people delay pushing the button for a while and I'm sure you are all intimately familiar\nwith that procedure.\nYet when it comes to starting startups a lot of people seem to think they are supposed to start them in college. Are you\ncrazy? What are the universities thinking \u2013 they go out of their way to ensure that their students are well supplied with\ncontraceptives, and yet they are starting up entrepreneurship programs and startup incubators left and right.\nTo be fair, the universities have their hand forced here. A lot of incoming students are interested in start-ups. Universities\nare at least de-facto supposed to prepare you for your career, and so if you're interested in startups, it seems like\nuniversities are supposed to teach you about startups and if they don't maybe they lose applicants to universities that do\nclaim to do that. So can universities teach you about startups? Well, if not, what are we doing here? Yes and no, as I've\nexplained to you about start-ups. Essentially, if you want to learn French, universities can teach you linguistics. That is\nwhat this is. This is linguistics: we're teaching you how to learn languages and what you need to know is how a particular\nlanguage.\nWhat you need to know are the needs of your own users. You can't learn those until you actually start the company, which\nmeans that starting a startup is something you can intrinsically only learn by doing it. You can't do that in college for the\nreason I just explained. Startups take over your entire life. If you start a startup in college, if you start a startup as a\nstudent, you can't start a startup as a student because if you start a startup you\u2019re not a student anymore. You may be\nnominally a student but you won't even be that for very much longer. Given this dichotomy: which of the two paths should\nyou take?\nBe a real student and not start a startup or start a real startup and not be a student. Well, I can answer that one for you. I'm\ntalking to my own kids here. Do not start a startup in college. I hope I'm not disappointing anyone seriously. Starting a\nstartup could be a good component of a good life for a lot of ambitious people. This is just a part of a much bigger\nproblem that you are trying to solve. How to have a good life, right. Those that are starting a startup could be a good thing\nto do at some point. Twenty is not the optimal time to do it.\nThere are things that you can do in your early twenties that you cannot do as well before or after. Like plunge deeply into\nprojects on a whim that seem like they will have no pay off. Travel super cheaply with no sense of a deadline. In fact they\nare really isomorphic shapes in different domains.\nFor unambitious people your thing can be the dreaded failure to launch. For the ambitious ones it\u2019s a really valuable sort\nof exploration and if you start a startup at twenty and you are sufficiently successful you will never get to do it.\nMark Zuckerberg will never get to bum around a foreign country.

If it\u2019s too hard, what if you are not up to this challenge?\nThe answer is the fifth counter intuitive point. You can't tell. Your life so far has given you some idea of what your\nprospects might be if you wanted to become a mathematician or a professional football player. Boy, it\u2019s not every\naudience you can say that to. Unless you have had a very strange life indeed you have not done much that\u2019s like starting\na startup. Meaning starting a startup will change you a lot if it works out. So what you\u2019re trying to estimate is not just what\nyou are, but what you could become. And who can do that? Well, not me. for the last nine years it was my job to try to\nguess (I wrote \"predict\" in here and it came out as \"guess\"\u2014that\u2019s a very informative Freudian slip). Seriously it\u2019s easy to\ntell how smart people are in ten minutes. Hit a few tennis balls over the net, and do they hit them back at you or into the\nnet? The hard part and the most important part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become.\nThere may be no one at this point who has more experience than me in doing this. I can tell you how much an expert can\nknow about that. The answer is not much. I learned from experience to keep completely open mind about which start ups\nin each batch would turn out to be the stars. The founders sometimes thought they knew. Some arrived feeling confident\nthat they would ace Y Combinator just as they had aced every one of the few easy artificial tests they had faced in life so\nfar. Others arrived wondering what mistake had caused them to be admitted and hoping that no one discover it.\nThere is little to no correlation between these attitudes and how things turn out. I've read the same is true in the military.\nThe swaggering recruits are no more than likely to turn out to be really tough than the quiet ones and probably for the\nsame reason. The tests are so different from tests in people\u2019s previous lives. If you are absolutely terrified of starting a\nstartup you probably shouldn\u2019t do it. Unless you are one of those people who gets off on doing things you're afraid of.\nOtherwise if you are merely unsure of whether you are going to be able to do it, the only way to find out is to try, just not\nnow.\nSo if you want to start a startup one day, what do you do now in college? There are only two things you need initially, an\nidea and cofounders. The MO for getting both of those is the same which leads to our sixth and last counterintuitive point.\nThe way to get start up ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. I have written a whole essay on this and I am not going\nto repeat the whole thing here. But the short version is that if you make a conscious effort to try to think of startup ideas,\nyou will think of ideas that are not only bad but bad and plausible sounding. Meaning you and everybody else will be\nfooled by them. You'll waste a lot of time before realizing they're no good. The way to come up with good startup ideas is\nto take a step back. Instead of trying to make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your brain into the type that\nhas startup ideas unconsciously. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.\nThis is not only possible: Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Apple all got started this way. None of these companies were\nsupposed to be companies at first, they were all just side projects. The very best ideas almost always have to start as side\nprojects because they're always such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.\nHow do you turn your mind into the kind that has startup ideas unconsciously? One, learn about a lot of things that matter.\nTwo, work on problems that interest you. Three, with people you like and or respect. That's the third part incidentally, is\nhow you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.

On the other hand, history is even fuller of examples of parents that thought their kids were\nwasting their time and who were right.\nHow do you know if you\u2019re working on real stuff?

I find it very hard to make myself work on boring things even if they're supposed\nto be important. My life is full of case after case where I worked on things just because I was interested and they turned\nout to be useful later in some worldly way.\nY Combinator itself is something I only did because it seemed interesting. I seem to have some internal compass that\nhelps me out. This is for you not me and I don't know what you have in your heads. Maybe if I think more about it I can\ncome up some heuristics for recognizing genuinely interesting ideas. For now all I can give you is the hopelessly\nquestion begging advice. Incidentally this is the actual meaning of the phrase begging the question. The hopelessly\nquestion begging advice that if you\u2019re interested in generally interesting problems, gratifying your interest energetically is\nthe best way to prepare yourself for a startup and probably best way to live.\nAlthough I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem I can tell you about a large subset of\nthem. If you think of technology as something that\u2019s spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every point on the edge\nrepresents an interesting problem. Steam engine not so much maybe you never know. One guaranteed way to turn your\nmind into the type to start up ideas for them unconsciously. Is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology. To,\nas Paul Buchheit put it, \"Live in the future.\" And when you get there, ideas that seem uncannily prescient to other people\nwill seem obvious to you. You may not realize they're start up ideas, but you will know they are something that ought to\nexist.\nFor example back at Harvard in the mid 90s. A fellow grad student of my friends Robert and Trevor wrote his own voice\nover IP software. It wasn't meant to be a startup, he never tried to turn it into one. He just wanted to talk to his girlfriend in\nTaiwan without paying for long distance calls. Since he was an expert on networks, it seemed obvious to him that thing to\ndo was to turn the sound into packets and ship them over the internet for free. Why didn't everybody do this? They were\nnot good at writing this type of software. He never did anything with this. He never tried to turn this into a startup. That is\nhow the best startups tend to happen.\nStrangely enough the optimal thing to do in college if you want to be a successful startup founder is not some sort of new\nvocational version of college focused on entrepreneurship. It's the classic version of college is education its own sake. If\nyou want to start your own startup what you should do in college is learn powerful things and if you have genuine\nintellectual curiosity that\u2019s what you\u2019ll naturally tend to do if you just follow your own inclinations. The component of\nentrepreneurship, can never quite say that word with a straight face, that really matters is domain expertise. Larry Page is\nLarry Page because he was an expert on search and the way he became an expert on search was because he was\ngenuinely interested and not because of some ulterior motive. At its best starting a startup is merely a ulterior motive for\ncuriosity and you\u2019ll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive at the end of the process. So here is ultimate advice for\nyoung would be startup founders reduced to two words: just learn.\nAlright how much time do we have left? Eighteen minutes for questions good god. Do you guys have the questions?\nQ: Sure we will start with two questions. How can a nontechnical founder most efficiently contribute to a startup?\nA: If the startup is, if the startup is working in some domain, if it\u2019s not a pure technology startup but is working in some very\nspecific domain, like if it is Uber and the non technical founder was an expert in the limo business then actually then the\nnon technical founder would be doing most of the work. Recruiting drivers and doing whatever else Uber has to do and\nthe technical founder would be just writing the iPhone app which probably less, well iPhone and android app, which is\nless than half of it.

Do you guys have the questions?\nQ: Sure we will start with two questions. How can a nontechnical founder most efficiently contribute to a startup?\nA: If the startup is, if the startup is working in some domain, if it\u2019s not a pure technology startup but is working in some very\nspecific domain, like if it is Uber and the non technical founder was an expert in the limo business then actually then the\nnon technical founder would be doing most of the work.

If it\u2019s purely a technical start up the non technical founder does sales and brings coffee and\ncheeseburgers to the programmer.\nQ: Do you see any value in business school for people who want to pursue entrepreneurship?\nA: Basically no, it sounds undiplomatic, but business school was designed to teach people management. Management is\na problem that you only have in a startup if you are sufficiently successful. So really what you need to know early on to\nmake a start up successful is developing products. You would be better off going to design school if you would want to go\nto some sort of school. Although frankly the way to learn how to do it is just to do it.

Honestly the best way to learn on how to start a startup is just to just try to start it.\nYou may not be successful but you will learn faster if you just do it. Business schools are trying really hard to do this. They\nwere designed to train the officer core of large companies, which is what business seemed to be back when it was a\nchoice to be either the officer core of large companies or Joe's Shoe Store. Then there was this new thing, Apple, that\nstarted as small as Joe's Shoe Store and turns into this giant mega company but they were not designed for that world\nthey are good at what they\u2019re good at. They should just do that and screw this whole entrepreneurship thing.\nQ: Management is a problem only if you are successful. What about those first two or three people?\nA: Ideally you are successful before you even hire two or three people. Ideally you don't even have two or three people\nfor quite awhile. When you do the first hires in a startup they are almost like founders. They should be motivated by the\nsame things, they can\u2019t be people you have to manage. This is not like the office, these have to be your peers, you\nshouldn\u2019t have to manage them much.\nQ: So is it just a big no no, someone has to be managed no way they should be on the founding team.\nA: In the case were you are doing something were you need some super advanced technical thing and there is some\nboffin that knows this thing and no one else in this world including on how to wipe his mouth. It may be to your advantage\nto hire said boffin and wipe his mouth for him. As a general rule you want people who are self motivated early on they\nshould just be like founders.\nQ: Do you think we are currently in a bubble?\nA: I\u2019ll give you two answers to this question. One, ask me questions that are useful to this audience because these people\nare here to learn how to start startups, and I have more data in my head than anybody else and you're asking me\nquestions a reporter does because they cannot think of anything interesting to ask. I will answer your question. There is a\ndifference between prices merely being high and a bubble. A bubble is a very specific form of prices being high where\npeople knowingly pay high prices for something in the hope that they will be able to unload it later on some greater fool.\nThat's what happened in the late 90's, when VC's knowingly invested in bullshit startups thinking that they would be able\nto take those things public and unload them on other retail investors before everything blew up\nI was there for that at the epicenter of it all. That is not what is happening today. Prices are high, valuations are high, but\nvaluations being high does not mean a bubble. Every commodity has prices that go up and down in some sort of sine\nwave. Definitely prices are high. We tell people if you raise money, don't think the next time you raise money it\u2019s going to\nbe so easy, who knows maybe between now and then the Chinese economy will have exploded then there's a giant\ndisaster recession. Assume the worst. But bubble? No.\nQ: I am seeing a trend among young people and successful entrepreneurs where they don\u2019t want to start one great\ncompany but twenty. You are starting to see a rise in these labs attempts were they are going to try to launch a whole\nbunch of stuff, I don't have any stellar examples yet.\nA: Do you mean like IDEO?\nQ: No, like Idealab, Garrett Camp\u2019s new one...\nA: Oh yeah. There's this new thing were people start labs that are supposed to spin off startups. It might work, that's how\nTwitter started. In fact, I meant Idealab, not IDEO, that was another Freudian slip. Twitter was not Twitter at first. Twitter\nwas a side project at a company called Odeo that was supposed to be in the podcasting business, and you like\npodcasting business, do those words even grammatically go together? The answer turned out to be no as Evan\ndiscovered. As a side project they spun off Twitter and boy was that a dog wagging tail, people are starting these things\nthat are supposed to spin off startups, will it work? Quite possibly if the right people do it. You can't do it though, because\nyou have to do it with your own money.\nQ: What advice do you have for female co-founders as they are pursuing funding?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98f6ad1-5659-46b3-a527-f5f9ddef8a65": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98f6ad1-5659-46b3-a527-f5f9ddef8a65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51c56994-94b6-45e4-8664-3e5a1bb2f63c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "7f614390a55d0b73cee51cc9588ef010aacf294d14a583b77ca4d06718a66418", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42e54a4e-2fc5-4744-9500-29e2c15d21f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a2f33b9f32791c60ae23e56259876faa7852f7ed2be51270ae87ceb169838e64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "75bd0e72-d68d-47d7-a016-e81bb5de01e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1cc384735204eb36f504b1d74dbb4a2297feef7b6e7c3328c32a94bd6bc1ae0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "338d27e8b8f5c0e8cb40f11c7fb36f6034c08de79249bedc301bda11f4c76534", "text": "A: It probably is true that women have a harder time raising money. I have noticed this empirically and Jessica is just\nabout to publish a bunch of interviews on female founders and a lot of them said that they thought they had a harder time\nraising money, too. Remember I said the way to raise money? Make your start up actually do well and that's just\nespecially true in any case if you miss the ideal target from the VC's point of view in any respect. The way to solve that\nproblem is make the startup do really well. In fact, there was a point a year or two ago when I tweeted this growth graph of\nthis company and I didn't say who they were. I knew it would get people to start asking and it was actually a female\nfounded startup that was having trouble raising money, but their growth graph was stupendous. So I tweeted it, knowing\nall these VC's would start asking me, \u201cWho is that?\u201d Growth graphs have no gender, so if they see the growth graph first,\nlet them fall in love with that. Do well, which is generally good advice for all startups.\nQ: What would you learn in college right now?\nA: Literary theory, no just kidding. Honestly, I think I might try and study physics that\u2019s the thing I feel I missed. For some\nreason, when I was a kid computers were the thing, maybe they still are. I got very excited learning to write code and you\ncan write real programs in your bedroom. You can't build real accelerators, well maybe you can. Maybe physics, I noticed\nI sort of look longingly at physics so maybe. I don't know if that\u2019s going to be helpful starting a startup and I just told you to\nfollow your own curiosity so who cares if it's helpful, it'll turn out to be helpful.\nQ: What are your reoccurring systems in your work and personal life that make you efficient?\nA: Having kids is a good way to be efficient. Because you have no time left so if you want to get anything done, the\namount of done you do per time is high. Actually many parents, start up founders who have kids have made that point\nexplicitly. They cause you to focus because you have no choice.\nI wouldn't actually recommend having kids just to make you more focused. You know, I don't think I am very efficient, I\nhave two ways of getting work done. One is during Y Combinator, the way I worked on Y Combinator is I was forced to. I\nhad to set the application deadline, and then people would apply, and then there were all these applications that I had to\nrespond to by a certain time. So I had to read them and I knew if I read them badly, we would get bad startups so I tried\nreally hard to read them well. So I set up this situation that forced me to work. The other kind of work I do is writing essays.\nAnd I do that voluntarily, I am walking down the street and the essay starts writing itself in my head. I either force myself to\nwork on less exciting things; I can't help working on exciting things. I don't have any useful techniques for making myself\nefficient. If you work on things you like, you don't have to force yourself to be efficient.\nQ: When is a good time to turn a side project into a startup?\nA: You will know, right. So the question is when you turn a side project into a startup, you will know that it is becoming a\nreal startup when it takes over a alarming large percentage of your life, right. My god I've just spent all day working on this\nthing that\u2019s supposed to be a side project, I am going to fail all of my classes what am I going to do, right. Then maybe it\u2019s\nturning into a startup.\nQ: I know you talked a lot, earlier, about you'll know when your start up is doing extremely well, but I feel like in a lot of\ncases it's a gray line, where you have some users but not explosive growth that is up and to the right, what would you do\nor what would you recommend in those situations?

I don't know, that's like important enough to write a whole essay about. I don't\nknow the answer and I probably should write something about that, but I don't know. I figured out a technique for\ndetecting whether you have a taste for generally interesting problems. Which is whether you find working on boring\nthings intolerable and there are known boring things. Like literary theory and working in middle management in some\nlarge company. So if you can tolerate those things, then you must have stupendous self-discipline or you don't have a\ntaste for genially interesting problems and vice versa.\nQ: Do you like Snapchat?\nA: Snapchat? What do I know about Snapchat? We didn't fund them. I want another question.\nQ: If you hire people you like, you might get a monoculture and how do you deal with the blind spots that arise?\nA: Starting a startup is where many things will be going wrong. You can't expect it to be perfect. The advantage is of hiring\npeople you know and like are far greater than the small disadvantage of having some monoculture. You look at it\nempirically, at all the most successful startups, someone just hires all their pals out of college.\nAlright you guys thank you.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1918, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3939f77c-57d1-48b1-87b7-fe3a893854c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3939f77c-57d1-48b1-87b7-fe3a893854c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c03535b-9bcc-46ce-9171-0b2009aa76af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "363f661a3be8066288873fddc1faa3a356c748a284b7f3d80de61fc70bf634cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47d64374-9ebf-4a5c-968e-9c11edf6a36a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "ea379eb05fcb02383f6b8d44831c5613cd38d90101916382a20f75fbcc828ec8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ef69ebd-83de-4165-b2b0-f5c7a58557a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7952efa3ec8d101b0517b3a7ccec1b7cf6a848edf7b939c80e2dbd56c43828c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "17d69f7261405be3e8b42304a7e4b6a146b41d688383d7c556c16d7b9d1aca24", "text": "Thanks for having me. Today I am going to be talking about how to go from zero users to many users. I'm just assuming\nthat you have many great ideas in your head at this moment and you are thinking about what the next step is.\nA lot of my lecture is based off of mistakes I have made in the past. As Sam mentioned, I went to YC in 2010 and spent\nthree years going back and forth, pivoting a bunch of times, starting over a bunch of times, and I learned a lot about what\nnot to do if I were to start another startup after Homejoy. A lot of my advice comes from failure and understanding what\nyou shouldn't do and then using that to make generalizations about what you should do.\nJust a reminder that you should take all advice as directionally good guidance, but every business is different. You're\ndifferent, and I'm not you, so take everything with that in mind.\nWhen you start a startup you should have a lot of time on your hands to concentrate on the startup. I'm not saying that you\nshould quit school or quit work; what I'm saying is that you should have a lot of compressed time that is dedicated to\nimmersing yourself in the idea and developing solutions to the problem that you are trying to solve. For example, if you're\nin school it is better to have one or two days straight per week to work on your idea versus spending two hours here and\nthere every single day during the course of the week. It's like coding. There is a lot of context switching so being able to\nreally focus and immerse yourself is really important.\nWhen I first wrote this lecture I was thinking, what are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup?\nThe novice approach is thinking, \"I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build, build,\nbuild and then going to maybe tell one or two people and then I'm going to launch it on TechCrunch or somewhere like\nthat, and then I'm going to get lots of users.\"\nWhat really happens is because you did not get a lot of feedback, maybe you get a lot of people to your site, but no one\nsticks around because you didn't get that initial user feedback. If you're lucky enough to have some money in the bank\nyou might go buy some users but it just whittles out over time and you just give up. It is sort of a vicious cycle. I actually did\nthis once, and I did this while I was in YC. When I went through YC I didn't even launch a product. I didn't launch on\nTechCrunch which is the thing you should definitely do. You don't ever want to get into that cycle because you'll just end\nup with nothing good.\nThe next thing is that you have an idea and you should really think about what the idea is really solving. Like what is the\nactual problem. You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. And then you should think, \"How does\nthat problem relate to me? Am I really passionate about that problem?\" And then you should think, \"Okay it's a problem I\nhave, but is it a problem that other people have?\" And you verify that by going out and talking to people.\nOne of the biggest mistakes I've made involves my co-founder and I, who is also my brother. We started a company called\nPathjoy in 2009 or 2010. We had two goals in mind. One was to create a company that made people really happy, and to\ncreate a company that was very, very impactful. A good proxy for that is to just create a big huge company. And so we\nthought, okay, the problem we are solving is to make people happier. We first went to the notion of who are the people\nwho make people happy. We came up with life coaches and therapists. It seemed kind of obvious to create a platform for\nlife coaches and therapist. What happened as a result was that when we started using the product ourselves, we aren't\ncynical people by any means, but life coaches and therapists are just not people we would use ourselves. It was sort of\nuseless to us. So it wasn't even a problem that we had and it wasn't something that we were super passionate about\nbuilding out, yet we spent almost a year trying to do this.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4058, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ef69ebd-83de-4165-b2b0-f5c7a58557a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ef69ebd-83de-4165-b2b0-f5c7a58557a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c03535b-9bcc-46ce-9171-0b2009aa76af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "363f661a3be8066288873fddc1faa3a356c748a284b7f3d80de61fc70bf634cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3939f77c-57d1-48b1-87b7-fe3a893854c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "17d69f7261405be3e8b42304a7e4b6a146b41d688383d7c556c16d7b9d1aca24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e465cc7e-9fc1-477b-b4dc-d4874c4ee6cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fc45729dc2fd9abc2ef5e9d2c3b4ecdbc05feb56af093ef5996f0586217d266", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7952efa3ec8d101b0517b3a7ccec1b7cf6a848edf7b939c80e2dbd56c43828c5", "text": "One was to create a company that made people really happy, and to\ncreate a company that was very, very impactful.

The first\nthing you should do is think about the industry that you are getting yourself into. Whether it is big or whether it is huge,\nyou should really immerse yourself in that industry. And there are a number of ways to do this.\nOne is to really become a cog in that industry for a little bit. And so it might seem a little counterintuitive to do this because\nmost people say that if you really want to disrupt an industry you should really not be a player in it. Someone who spent\n20 or 30 years in an industry is probably set in their ways and is just used to the way things work and really can't think\nabout what the inefficiencies are or the things that you can \"disrupt\". However, as a newbie coming into the industry you\nreally should take one or two months to just really understand what all of the little bits and pieces of the industry are and\nhow it works. Because it's when you get into the details, that's when you start seeing things that you can be exploiting and\nthings that are really inefficient and may provide a huge overhead cost that you may be able to cut down.\nSo an example of this is that when we started Homejoy, we started with the cleaning industry, and when we started we\nwere the cleaners ourselves. We started to clean houses and we found out really quickly that we were very bad cleaners.\nAs a result, we said okay, we have to learn more about this and we went to buy books. We bought books about how to\nclean, which helped maybe a little bit. We learned a little more about cleaning supplies but it is sort of like basketball, you\ncan read and learn about basketball but you're not going to get better at it if you don't actually train and throw a basketball\ninto the net.\nAnd so we decided that one of us was going to have to learn how to clean. Or at least get trained by a professional. We\nactually went to get a job at a cleaning company itself. The cool thing was I learned how to clean from training the few\nweeks that I was there at the cleaning company, but the even better thing was that I learned a lot about how a local\ncleaning company works. In that sense I learned why a local cleaning company could not become huge like Homejoy is\ntoday. And that is because they are pretty old school and they have a lot of things that are done inefficiently. Such as\nbooking the customer and optimizing the cleaners' schedules was just done very inefficiently.\nIf you are in a situation like mine where there is a service element of it then you should go and do that service yourself. If\nyour thing is related to restaurants you should become a waiter, if it is related to painting become a painter and kind of get\nin the shoes of your customers from all angles of what you are trying to build.\nThe other thing is there is also a level of obsessiveness that you should have with it as well. You should be so obsessed\nthat you want to know what everybody in that space is doing. And it is things like writing a list of all of the potential\ncompetitors, similar types of companies, and Google searching them and clicking on every single link and reading every\nsingle article from search result number 1 to 1000. I found all potential competitors big and small and if they were public, I\nwould go and read their S-1s, I would go read all of their quarterly financials, I would sit on earnings calls. You know most\nof these, you don't get much out of it but there are these golden nuggets that you will find every once in a while. And you\nwon't be able to find that unless you actually go through the work of getting all that information in your head. You should\nbecome an expert in your industry. There should be no doubt when you are building this that you are the expert so that\npeople trust you when you are building this product.\nThe second thing is identifying customer segments. Ideally at the end of the day you have built a product or business that\neverybody in the world is using. In the beginning, you realistically want to corner off a certain part of the customer base so\nthat you can really optimize for them. It is just about focus and whether you are catering to teenage girls or whether it is\nsoccer moms, you will be able to focus a lot on their needs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4311, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f0b0b02-3684-44d9-ac11-f64eb2279dc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f0b0b02-3684-44d9-ac11-f64eb2279dc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee6ae306-b1fc-4034-a194-0cb3b50a73b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2c39508f88094a29515df015d2aca1d38c0f817f4411283a202c5acba8c266eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e465cc7e-9fc1-477b-b4dc-d4874c4ee6cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "4fc45729dc2fd9abc2ef5e9d2c3b4ecdbc05feb56af093ef5996f0586217d266", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fda467a6-a411-44f4-b95a-0cc26ef5ac31", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4dc787371003e4c880d86ff1cb9ceb32b10b1510366711eb8a7e8ac162c7bdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "31fe7ee1fd7c078d0092ca1e850c65ea5d60cdeb48a20eac046e3f68a47dcf62", "text": "You know most\nof these, you don't get much out of it but there are these golden nuggets that you will find every once in a while.

You start building your product. The common phrase\nthat most people use today is,\" You should build a minimum viable product.\" And I underlined viable because I think a lot\nof people skip that part and they go out with a feature and the whole user experience in the very beginning is flat. Minimal\nviable product pretty much means what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you are\ntrying to solve. I think if you go through the whole storyboarding experience you can kind of figure that out very quickly.\nBut again, you have to be talking to users, you have to be seeing what exists out there already, and what you should be\nbuilding should solve their immediate needs.\nAnd the second thing is that before you put things in front of the user you should really have your product positioning\ndown. What I mean by that is that you should be able to go to a person and be able to say, \"Hey, this does X,Y, and Z in\none sentence.\" So for example, at Homejoy we started off with something super complicated. We were an online platform\nfor home services, you start with cleaning and you can choose blah blah blah. It just went on for paragraphs and\nparagraphs.\nWhen we went to potential users to come on our platform they would kind of get bored after the first few sentences. What\nwe found out was that we needed a one-liner. The one-liner was very important. It kind of describes the functional\nbenefits of what you do. In the future when you are trying to build a brand or whatnot you should be able to describe the\nemotional benefits and stuff like that. But when you are starting with no users you really need to tell them what they are\ngoing to get out of it. After we changed our position to get your place cleaned for $20 an hour, then everyone got it and\nwe were able to get users in the door that way.\nSo you have an MVP out there, now how do you get your first few users to start trying it? The first few users should be\nobviously people you are connected with. You and your cofounder should be using it, your mom and dad should be\nusing it, and your friends and coworkers should be using it. Beyond that, you want to get more user feedback. I've listed\nhere some of the obvious places to go to depending on what you are selling. You can take your pick of the draw here. So,\nonline communities, on Hacker News now there is the show HN - that's a great place. Especially if you are building tools\nfor developers and things like that. Local communities - so if you're building consumer products you know there are a lot\nof influential local community mailing lists. Especially those for parents. Those are places you might want to hit up too.\nAt Homejoy we actually tried all of these. We used it ourselves and that was fine. We were the only cleaners so that was\npretty easy. Our parents live in Milwaukee and we were based in Mountain View so that didn't work. Friends and\ncoworkers were kind of like in San Francisco and elsewhere so we didn't have too many of them use it. So we actually\nended up in a dead end of not being able to convince many people to use it in the beginning. So what we did was,\nbecause we are in Mountain View, some of you guys might know on Castro Street they have street fairs there during the\nsummertime. So we would go out and basically chase down people and get them to try to book a cleaning. Almost\neveryone would say no until one day we just took advantage of the weather. It was a very hot and humid day and what\nwe noticed was that everyone gravitated towards the food and drink area, especially on a hot day.\nWe figured we needed to get in the middle of that so we took water bottles and froze them and we started handing out\nfree bottles of water that were cold.

Get away from your desk and just get out and do the work. It seems like a slog and it is going to be a slog but this is\nwhere you are going to get the best feedback ever for your product. And this is where it is going to teach you what\nfeatures you need to completely change, get rid of, or what features you need to build.\nOne way to do this is to send out surveys to get reviews after they have used the product. This is okay but generally\npeople are only going to respond if they really love you or they really hate you. And you never get the in between. A way\nto get the in between and not all of the extremes is to actually meet the person that is using your product. I've seen people\ngo out to meet the user and they sit there and it is like a laboratory and it is like an inquisition. You're just kind of poking at\nthem. That is not going to give you the best results. What you should really do is make it into a conversation and get to\nknow them and get them to feel comfortable. You want to get them at a level where they feel like they should be honest\nwith you to help you improve things. So I found that actually taking people out for drinks and stuff like that was actually a\nvery good way to do that. I'm not sure if all of you are old enough to do that but you can take them for coffee.\nSo another thing that you should be tracking is how are you doing in general from a macro perspective. The best way to\ndo that is by tracking customer retention. The number of people that came in the door today, the number of people who\nare coming back tomorrow, the next day and so forth. Usually over time you are kind of looking at monthly retention so\npeople who came in the door today, are they still using it next month and so forth. The problem with that metric is that it\ntakes forever to collect that data and sometimes you don't have a month or two months or three months to figure that out.\nSo a good leading indicator is actually collecting reviews and ratings. Such as five-star and four-star reviews or collecting\nsome notion of nps, which is net promoter score. So you're basically asking them for a rating from 0 to 10 about how likely\nare they to recommend you to a friend and calculating the nps.\nOver time what you'll see is that as you are building new features, you will be able to see that the reviews and the\nretention are going up over time. That means that you are doing a good job. If it is going down then you are doing a bad\njob. If it is kind of staying the same that probably means that you need to go out and figure out what new things you\nshould be building.\nOne thing you should be wary of is the honesty curve. Some people will just lie to you. These are degrees of separation\nfrom you, and this is the level of honesty. So here this is your mom, these are the friends of your friends and here are\nrandom people. Your mom will use your product and she will be proud of you anyway, so she'll be honest this much. Your\nfriends will be pretty honest with you and give you feedback because they care about you - this is assuming this is a free\nproduct - and then over time as you get more and more random, these people don't know who you are. There are people\nover here who don't care about giving you feedback. So take this into consideration when getting user feedback.\nSo say now this is a paid product. So when it is a paid product your mom is down here. She is just going to lie to you and\ntell you it's great. But then it kind of goes like this (draws graph going upward). Your friends are going to support you and\ngive you the right feedback but it is actually these random people out here that if they really don't think that what they paid\nfor was worth it, they are going to really tell you.

Because that is when you can get to the more meaty stuff of how you can get more paying users in the\ndoor.\nYou're getting a lot of feedback and what do you do before you officially launch the product? You always want to be\nbuilding fast and you want to be optimizing for this stage of your growth. You might have 10 users at this point and there\nis no point in trying to build features for when you might have 10 million users. You want to optimize for the next stage of\ngrowth which will be 10 to 100 users. What are the features you really need for that and just go with that. One of the things\nI found when building a marketplace is that process is very important over time as you scale.\nYou need to not try and automate everything and create software to have robots run everything.

And then they would go to a test clean and then they would get onboarded to our\nplatform if they were good enough. Doing all these questions for that many candidates we had a 3-5% acceptance rate.\nWhat happened over time was that we learned certain questions that we were asking were good indicators as to whether\nor not they would be a good or bad performer on the platform through data collection and just looking at everything we\ncould ask on an online form. That is when we put up an online application, they could apply and then we would ask them\nmaybe several other questions during the in person interview. If you try to automate things too fast then you run into this\npotential problem of not being able to move quickly and iterate things like questions on an application and things like\nthat.\nA third point here is temporary brokenness is much better than permanent paralysis. By that what I mean is perfection is\nirrelevant during this stage. When you get to the next stage of growth what you are trying to perfect in one stage is not\ngoing to matter anyway. So do not worry about all of the edge cases when you are building something, just worry about\nthe generic case of who your core user is going to be. As you get bigger and bigger the volume of those edge cases\nincreases over time and you will want to build for that.\nLastly beware of the Frankenstein approach which is - great you talked to all of these users and they gave you all of these\nideas and the first thing you are going to want to do is go build every single one of them and then go show them the next\nday and make them happier. You should definitely listen to user feedback but when someone tells you to build a feature\nyou shouldn't go build it right away. What you should really do is get to the bottom of why they are asking you to build the\nfeature. Usually what they are suggesting is not the best idea. What they are really suggesting is that I have this other\nproblem that you either created for me while using the product or I really need this problem solved if I'm going to pay to\nuse this product. So figure that out first before piling on a bunch of features which then hide the problem altogether.\nSo you have a product that you are ready to ship - some people at this point will continue building the product and not\nship it at all. I think the whole idea of being stealth and perfecting the product to no end is the idea that imitation is\ncheaper than innovation in terms of time and money and capital. I think that everyone should always assume in general\nthat if you have a really good idea no matter when you launch someone is going to fast follow you and someone is going\nto execute as hard as they possibly can to catch up with you. There is no point in holding out on all of that user feedback\nthat you can get by getting a lot of users because he felt paranoid that someone is going to do this to you.\nI hate to keep harping on it but these are things that I see today with founders and something that I went through as well.\nAnd I think that unless you are building something that requires tens of millions of dollars just to start up there is really no\npoint in waiting around to launch the product.\nSo say you have something that you feel ready to get lots of users on. So what do you do at this point? I will go over\nvarious types of growth in the next slides, but the one thing to note here early on when it is just you, your cofounder, and a\ncouple of other people building, you aren't creating a team just for growth. It is going to be one person and one person\nonly. You really need to focus and you are going to be tempted to try five different strategies at one time.\nBut really what you should do is take one channel and really execute on it for an entire week and just focus on that.

And lastly, in the beginning when you see a channel that fails just to\nget rid of it and go on there are lots of other things to try. But over time go back to that channel and look at it again.\nAn example is that in the beginning at Homejoy we had no money so when we tried to buy Google ads to get users in the\ndoor quickly - what we found was that all of these national companies had more money than us, they were making a lot", "start_char_idx": 3682, "end_char_idx": 5125, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db80d04d-8b55-42aa-962b-2ce2e073a471": {"__data__": {"id_": "db80d04d-8b55-42aa-962b-2ce2e073a471", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e95f8e28-815d-4407-8af9-b9e8c01e0a9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "f8ae35c1cfee0ab06f499350fa4b4a251675a1b2a3eed7231d885d6767f67677", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4038169c-10f4-4c03-99d2-e5e9f5796265", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "8833d764a976e0419c5cea201c4ae894c7698836c83f9ab90f24e146648b7021", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7b164ac-3102-482a-83a2-067831dd8525", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6323f94b0be18f043a054e64a271dcf678ad295f47041c8b309e6f560e904f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e08248ce9a8533190d85739d63322c7a1034ee008751b2414ccef041d02cfdc9", "text": "more money on the job than us.

So you always have to find that little thing that no one else is doing and do that to the extreme.\nSo there are three types of growth. Sticky, viral, and paid growth. Sticky growth is trying to get your existing users to come\nback and pay you more or use you more. Viral growth is when people talk about you. So you use a product, you really\nlike it and you tell ten other friends, and they like it. That's viral growth. And the third is paid growth. If you happen to have\nmoney in the bank you're going to be able to use part of that money to buy growth.\nThe central theme that I'm going to go through is sustainability. By sustainable growth I mean you are basically not a\nleaky bucket. The money you put in has a good return investment on it. So sticky growth is, like I said, trying to get your\nexisting users to come back and buy stuff. The only thing that really matters here is that you deliver a good experience.\nRight? If you deliver a good experience people are going to want to keep using you. If you deliver an addictive\nexperience people are going to want to keep using you. And the way to measure this and to really look at this and how\nyou are doing over time with whether you are providing good sticky growth is to look at the CLV and retention cohort\nanalysis.\nCLV, some people call it TLV, is a customer's lifetime. It is basically the net revenue that a customer brings in the door\nover a period of time. So a 12 month CLV is how much net revenue does a customer give you over 12 months. And\nsometimes people will do the month and six months and so forth. So when I say cohort basically what you are looking at\nis, this is time, and this is percent of the users coming back to you. So at period zero you are at 100%.\nSo cohort is another name for customer segments. For example you might look at the female versus male cohorts or\npeople in Atlanta, Georgia versus people in Sacramento, California cohorts. The most common one is by month. So\ncohort equals month and let's just say for this exercise we are looking at March 2012. So in March 2012, 100% of the\npeople are using your product. Now, one month later 50% of the people might come back. Now, in the second month how\nmany people that came in March are coming back two months later? That might be down. So over time you will have a\ncurve that looks like this. There is always some initial drop off. The reasons that people don't stay after first use could be\nthat it wasn't worth it or they had a bad experience, or something like that. And then over time what you want is for your\ncurve to flatten out. These over here become your core customers. These are the ones that will stay with you over time.\nSay we are at one year later and you have built a bunch of stuff. You graph out the same thing and hopefully what you\nsee is that you have a curve like this. That is, that even in the first period more than 50% of the people came back to you\nand more and more people are sticking with you. A really bad retention curve looks like this - which is after the first use\nthey just hate you so much that no one even comes back. I don't know what kind of business that is, it is obviously a shitty\nbusiness. I can't explain a good business that has a retention curve like that. Over time as you are thinking of strategies to\nincrease this curve and to keep making it go up and up and up you want to keep looking at this analysis over time to see\nif that strategy is working for you.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7b164ac-3102-482a-83a2-067831dd8525": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7b164ac-3102-482a-83a2-067831dd8525", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e95f8e28-815d-4407-8af9-b9e8c01e0a9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "f8ae35c1cfee0ab06f499350fa4b4a251675a1b2a3eed7231d885d6767f67677", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db80d04d-8b55-42aa-962b-2ce2e073a471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e08248ce9a8533190d85739d63322c7a1034ee008751b2414ccef041d02cfdc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36c60883-653c-4e28-bd14-924d9d2e7079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eee22a37a75848a801b7dc1b885474bbb3a4b8f8a5c3e393fa1d3497da1cb315", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6323f94b0be18f043a054e64a271dcf678ad295f47041c8b309e6f560e904f26", "text": "These are the ones that will stay with you over time.\nSay we are at one year later and you have built a bunch of stuff.

Like sticky growth you also need to deliver a good experience. But on top of\nthat you need to deliver a really, really good experience. What is going to make these people shout out loud on Twitter or\non Facebook or whatever and tell all their friends and email all of their family about you. You have to really deliver a good\nexperience. Combined with that is you have to have really good mechanics for the referral program itself. You have 100\ncustomers who really want to talk about you. Now how are they going to talk about you?\nSo in that sense the viral growth strategy is all about building a good experience, but if you have that, how do you build a\ngood referral program. I have listed the three main parts of that. One is the customer touch points which is where are\npeople learning that they can refer other people? That might be after they book or after they sign up. A better one is after\nthey use the product for a while and you see that they are highly engaged, then you show them that link and get them to\nsend it out to everyone. Another one is if you are doing more of a platform type play - for Homejoy we actually go inside", "start_char_idx": 3217, "end_char_idx": 5232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36c60883-653c-4e28-bd14-924d9d2e7079": {"__data__": {"id_": "36c60883-653c-4e28-bd14-924d9d2e7079", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0dd9682e-0807-4046-8d31-f0e23bedad33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "12219065a5f437349ad287f602f6e1b8581e619ac381bc0cdfcb00e84ea0beb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7b164ac-3102-482a-83a2-067831dd8525", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6323f94b0be18f043a054e64a271dcf678ad295f47041c8b309e6f560e904f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf089816-2b8d-4e38-ad42-7a73d5b8e11d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50c109a136529b2be12c889d539900cc5f8cde127abb357b74af9499093c3278", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eee22a37a75848a801b7dc1b885474bbb3a4b8f8a5c3e393fa1d3497da1cb315", "text": "their home. So another customer touch point is when the cleaning professional is inside the home they can have a leave\nbehind and we can show them something there too as well. You want to basically put the customer touch points and the\nactual link to however they are going to refer their friends at a point in time where they are highly engaged and you know\nthat they are loving you.\nThe second is program mechanics. The most common thing I have seen is $10 for $10. You get $10 if you invite your\nfriends and they use it and they get $10. And so you should try different types of mechanics in that sense and try to\noptimize for whatever works for you. It could be 25 for 25 or it could be 10 for 10, it could be any of these things. And\nlastly, when your friend clicks on your referral link, when they come back to the site it is really important to optimize that\nconversion flow of how they are going to sign up. Sometimes you need to sell them in a different manner or up-sell that a\nfriend suggested that you use this and so forth. So with all of these combined, you will really need to play around with\nthem in different dimensions and come up with a good referral program.\nAnd lastly is paid growth. Some examples of paid growth are this right here. And these are some of the most obvious\nones and I'm sure that you guys can think of more. Paid growth is you happen to have money you can spend - you may\nhave credit cards or whatever - but you can spend something to get users. So the correct way to think about paid growth\nis that you are going to risk putting money out there so that are you going to get a return. The simple way to think about it -\nis your CLV, your customer's lifetime - is it more than your CAC. And your CAC is an abbreviation for customer acquisition\ncosts. So an example is - say you run a bunch of ads over 12 months and the customer is worth $300 to you. Each one of\nthese ads, when you click on it the CPC costs different types of money, and then when they click on your ad they have to\ncome to the site and sign up or buy something.\nAnd the conversion rates are different for all of these ads. The CAC is calculated by the CPC divided by the conversion.\nSo you see that there are different acquisition costs for different types of ads. To determine whether or not that is a good\nor bad ad all you have to do is CLV minus the CAC. If it is more than zero you are earning a profit. So you see that despite\nthe CLV remaining the same and the conversions being higher or lower sometimes some ads that might seem good\nactually don't seem so good at the end of the day.\nYou can look at this for your whole entire customer base, aggregating all of your customers together, but the better way of\nlooking at it is to break it down by customer segments. If you are building a marketplace for country music the CLVs of\nsomeone in Nashville, Tennessee is going to be much larger than the CLVs of someone in Czechoslovakia. I just\nassume that is the case anyway.\nYou will want to make sure that when you are buying ads for these different types of cohorts that you know what the\ndifferences are and you don't want to mix everything together. The last point on payback and sustainability - I think a lot of\nbusinesses get in trouble and they turn into bad businesses when they start spending beyond their means. And it has a\nlot to do with risk tolerance or how much risk you are willing to take on.\nSo when you look at these CLVs, which is suppose you get a customer that is worth $300 after 12 months. In the first\nmonth they are worth $100. If you wait until the 12 month period then they give you the other $200. But if in the first period\nyou are actually paying $200 for them then you are in the hole for $100 until the end of the 12 month period. That's when\nyou start to get into potentially unsustainable growth. Something could happen at the end of the 12 months where you\ndon't actually get the $200 from the customer and you end up in a very bad situation. Essentially, at the end of the day\nyou could be running out of money. And if you are doing this with credit cards you will definitely find that you are going to\nhave to declare bankruptcy very soon.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4189, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf089816-2b8d-4e38-ad42-7a73d5b8e11d": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf089816-2b8d-4e38-ad42-7a73d5b8e11d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0dd9682e-0807-4046-8d31-f0e23bedad33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "12219065a5f437349ad287f602f6e1b8581e619ac381bc0cdfcb00e84ea0beb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36c60883-653c-4e28-bd14-924d9d2e7079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "eee22a37a75848a801b7dc1b885474bbb3a4b8f8a5c3e393fa1d3497da1cb315", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73812ac2-5ccb-4b9d-8b8f-8a94bda45f53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d3661c62b14ef57583cc587ec0e74d2cca5cfabc5937131d7dabb947447fd8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "50c109a136529b2be12c889d539900cc5f8cde127abb357b74af9499093c3278", "text": "So when you look at these CLVs, which is suppose you get a customer that is worth $300 after 12 months.

So the trick here is what you really should do is\nhave a growth plan when you start out. What is an optimistic but realistic way to grow this business? it might look\nsomething like this. In week one you just want one user, in week two you want maybe two users and so forth. And you\ncan keep doubling up and up.\nIn week one you should basically build as much as possible to get that one user. And then a week to build as much to get\ntwo users. If you have a product that people want you should be able to maintain this growth curve pretty easily by just\nwalking around and manually finding people. It is when you get to 100 users a week when you need these growth\nstrategies to start working. What I tell people is usually if you are fully executing on your product, and you are working\nreally hard, then if you go three or four weeks in a row of no growth or backwards growth, then it is time to maybe\nconsider a pivot.\nMaybe not in the sense that you completely come up with a new idea but you are probably fundamentally doing\nsomething wrong because at that early stage a startup should always be growing. This is optimistically what it looks like\nand this is the kind of growth curve that I set forth and put out when I started Homejoy, but really what it looks like is like\nthis. So you want to make sure that when you are in a lull you don't stop. And that is what you should wait 2 to 3 weeks.\nAs long as you don't stop working hard you'll eventually get back here and you'll see a trend like this over time.\nI can take questions at this time.\nQ: So one question online was if your users already have a product that they are already comfortable with how do you get\nthem to switch to yours?\nA: There is always a switchover cost. I will tell you the example of Homejoy. We were actually creating a new market in\nthe sense that a lot of our initial users had never had cleanings before so it was pretty simple to get them on board. And a\nlot of people who have cleaners already really trust their cleaner. To get them to come and use something else is\nprobably the most difficult task in the world. When you are building things and trying to get people to switch over to you\nwhat you really need to do is find the moments where your product or what you are offering is much better or very much\ndifferentiated from the existing solution they have.\nSo an example is someone who had a regular cleaner and maybe had a party one day and they needed a cleaning\nalmost the next day. Because Homejoy in most areas has next-day availability they would just come to Homejoy and use\nit because they knew they couldn't get their regular cleaner. And once they start using the product, then that is when they\nstart realizing the little advantages of using Homejoy, which adds up to a big advantage. Realizing that leaving cash out\nor using checks was really annoying so being able to do all of your payments online was more convenient. Being able to\ncancel or reschedule according to your own schedule was very convenient.\nA lot of people when they build a product they are like - and these 50 things are better than the existing solution - and\neven if the benefits outweigh the switchover cost it is really hard to actually tell that to a user and try to get them to\naggregate all of those benefits over many little things. It is better to have one or two things that clearly differentiate\nyourself from the other product.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "116f71cd-46a4-4b32-ac6d-e6f694f7896f": {"__data__": {"id_": "116f71cd-46a4-4b32-ac6d-e6f694f7896f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20667dc7-084b-42ea-9f62-9f74e0ed3fee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "41cbeb0245cd5c5a6ee7819828e886b53f5d09b0cff1a98b28f1be15bf61694e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "73812ac2-5ccb-4b9d-8b8f-8a94bda45f53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "7d3661c62b14ef57583cc587ec0e74d2cca5cfabc5937131d7dabb947447fd8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21e03564-f52d-42cd-bb9f-b936819c383c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ba6e34a46f6a6dc48b485d8e5d1c2f01ac7e6a1203ca6f4ed24e5e9f995932d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "71123bb9162f3c7d5acb39b97aa1cf330e435018b7ba3bed5c3d3769239bf042", "text": "Sam: Alright, good afternoon, today\u2019s speaker is Peter Thiel, Peter was the founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders\nFund and has invested in most of the tech companies in Silicon Valley. He's going to talk about strategy and competition.\nThank you for coming, Peter.\nPeter: Awesome, thanks Sam for inviting me, thanks for having me.\nI sort of have a single id\u00e9e fixe that I'm completely obsessed with on the business side which is that if you're starting a\ncompany, if you\u2019re the founder, entrepreneur, starting a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to\nalways avoid competition. And so hence competition is for losers, something we\u2019ll be talking about today.\nI'd like to start by saying something about the basic idea of when you start one of these companies, how do you go about\ncreating value? What makes a business valuable? And I want to suggest there's basically a very simple formula, that if\nyou have a valuable company two things are true. Number one, that it creates \"X\" dollars of value for the world. Number\ntwo, that you capture \"Y\" percent of \"X.\u201d And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that\n\"X\" and \"Y\" are completely independent variables, and so \"X\" can be very big and \"Y\" can be very small. \"X\" can be an\nintermediate size and if \"Y\u201d is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business.\nSo to create a valuable company you have to basically both create something of value and capture some fraction of the\nvalue of what you've created. And sort of just to illustrate this as a contrast, if you compare the US airline industry with a\ncompany like Google on search, if you measure by the size of these industries you could say that airlines are still more\nimportant than search, just measured by revenue. [For airline carriers] there\u2019s $195 billion in domestic revenues in 2012;\nGoogle had just north of $50 billion. And certainly on some intuitive level if you were given a choice and said, well would\nyou want to get rid of all air travel, or do you want to give up search engines, the intuition would be that air travel is\nsomething that's more important than search. And this is of course just the domestic numbers.\nIf you'd look at this globally, airlines are much much bigger than search, than Google is, but the profit margins are quite a\nbit less. They were marginally profitable in 2012, I think in the entire hundred year history of the airline industry, the\ncumulative profits in the US have been approximately zero. The companies make money, they episodically go bankrupt,\nthey get recapitalized, and you sort of cycle and repeat. And this is reflected in the combined market capitalization of the\nairline industry, which may be something like a quarter of Google's. So you have search much smaller than air travel but\nmuch more valuable. I think this reflects these very different valuations on \"X\" and \"Y.\"\nIf we look at perfect competition, there's some pros and cons to the world of perfect competition. On a high level, this is\nsomething you always study in Econ I, it's always easy to model, which is why I think econ professors like talking about\nperfect competition. It somehow is efficient, especially in a world where things are static, because you have all the\nconsumer surplus that\u2019s captured by everybody, and politically it\u2019s what we\u2019re told is good in our society: you want to\nhave competition and it\u2019s somehow a good thing. Of course there are a lot of negatives, it's generally not that good if\nyou're involved in anything that\u2019s hyper competitive, because you often don't make money. I\u2019ll come back to this a little bit\nlater. So I think on one end of the spectrum you have industries that are perfectly competitive and at the other end of the\nspectrum you have things that I would say are monopolies, and they\u2019re much more stable longer term businesses, you\nhave more capital, and if you get a creative monopoly for inventing something new, I think it's symptomatic of having\ncreated something really valuable.\nI do think the extreme binary view of the world I always articulate is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this\nworld, there are businesses that are perfectly competitive and there are businesses that are monopolies.

If you imagine that there was a spectrum of companies from perfect\ncompetition to monopoly, the apparent differences are quite small because the people who have monopolies pretend not\nto. They will basically say, and it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to get regulated by the government, you don\u2019t want the\ngovernment to come after you, so you will never say that you have a monopoly. So anyone who has a monopoly will\npretend that they are in incredible competition; and on the other end of the spectrum if you are incredibly competitive, and\nif you\u2019re in some sort of business where you will never make any money, you'll be tempted to tell a lie that goes in the\nother direction, where you will say that you're doing something unique that is somehow less competitive than it looks\nbecause you'll want to differentiate, you will want to try and attract capital, or something like that. So if the monopolists\npretend not to have monopolies, the non-monopolies pretend to have monopolies, the apparent difference is very small\nwhereas the real difference I would submit is actually quite big. So there\u2019s this business distortion that happens because\nof the lies people tell about their businesses and the lies are sort of in these opposite directions.\nLet me drill a little bit down further on the way these lies work. And so the basic lie you tell as a non-monopoly is that\nwe're in a very small market. The basic lie you tell as a monopoly is the market you\u2019re in is much bigger than it looks. So\ntypically if you want to think of this in set theoretic terms, you could say that a monopoly tells a lie where you describe\nyour business as the union of these vastly different markets and the non-monopolist describes it as the intersection. So in\neffect, if you're a non-monopolist you will rhetorically describe your market as super small, you're the only person in that\nmarket. If you have a monopoly you'll describe it as super big and there's lots of competition in it.\nSome examples of how this works in practice. I always use restaurants as the example of a terrible business, this is\nalways sort of the idea that capital [accumulation] and competition are antonyms. If someone accumulates capital, a world\nof perfect competition is a world where all the capital gets competed away. So you're opening a restaurant business, no\none wants to invest because you just lose money, so you have to tell some idiosyncratic narrative and you'll say\nsomething like. \"Well we're the only British food restaurant in Palo Alto.\u201d So its British, Palo Alto and of course that's too\nsmall a market because people may be able to drive all the way to Mountain View or even Menlo Park and there\nprobably are no people who eat nothing but British food, at least no people who are still alive.\nSo that's sort of a fictitiously narrow market. There is sort of a Hollywood version of all of this, the way movies always get\npitched, where it\u2019s like a college football star, you know, joins an elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his\nfriend. Now that's a movie that has not yet been made, but the question is, \"Is that the right category or is the correct\ncategory, it's just another movie?\" In which case there are lots of those, it\u2019s super competitive, it\u2019s incredibly hard to make\nmoney, no one ever makes money in Hollywood making movies, it\u2019s really really hard.\nSo you always have this question about is the intersection real? Does it make sense? Does it have value? And of course\nthere are startup versions of this, and in the really bad versions you just take a whole series of the buzzwords: sharing,\nmobile, social apps, you combine them and give some kind of narrative and whether or not that's a real business or not, it\nis generally a bad sign. It's almost this pattern recognition when you have this rhetoric of these sort of intersections, it\ngenerally does not work.

So if it was search you would say, well it's like it has this huge market share that's really\ncrazy, so it's like an incredible monopoly, it's a much bigger and much more robust monopoly than Microsoft ever had in\nthe nineties, maybe that's why it\u2019s making so much money. But if you say it's an advertising market, you could say well,\nsearch advertising is seventeen billion and that's part of online advertising, which is much bigger and then, you know, all\nUS advertising is bigger, and then by the time you get to global advertising, that's close to five hundred billion and so\nyou're talking about three and a half percent, so a tiny part of this much larger market.\nOr if you don't want to be an advertising company, you could always say you\u2019re a technology company.

So I think one has to always be super aware that there are these very powerful incentives to distort the\nnature of these markets, one way or the other.\nThe evidence of narrow markets in the tech industry is if you basically just, if you look at sort of the big tech companies,\nApple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they have just been building up cash for year after year and you have these incredibly\nhigh profit margins, and I would say that the that one of the reasons the tech industry in the US has been so successful\nfinancially is because it's prone to creating all these monopoly-like businesses and it's reflected by the fact that these\ncompanies just accumulate so much cash they don't even know what to do with it beyond a certain point.\nLet me say a few things about how to build a monopoly, and I think one of the sort of very counterintuitive ideas that\ncomes out of this monopoly thread is that you want to go after small markets. If you\u2019re a startup, you want to get to\nmonopoly. You\u2019re starting a new company, you want to get to monopoly. Monopolies have a large share of the market,\nhow do you get to a large share of the market? You start with a really small market and you take over the whole market\nand then over time you find ways to expand that market in concentric circles.\nThe thing that's always a big mistake is going after a giant market on day one because that's typically evidence that you\nsomehow haven't defined categories correctly, that normally means there is going to be too much competition in one way\nor another, so I think almost all the successful companies in Silicon Valley had some model of starting with small markets\nand expanding. If you take Amazon, you start with just a bookstore, we have all the books in the world, it's a better\nbookstore than anybody else has in the world when it starts in the 1990s. It's online, there's things you can do that you\ncould not do before, and then you gradually expand into all sorts of different forms of e-commerce and other things\nbeyond that.\neBay, you start with Pez dispensers, you move on to Beanie Babies, and eventually it\u2019s all these different online auctions\nfor all these sorts of different goods. What\u2019s very counterintuitive about many of these companies is they often start with\nmarkets that are so small, that people don't think they are valuable at all when you get started. The PayPal version of this\nwas we started with power sellers on Ebay, which was about twenty thousand people. When we first saw this happening\nin December of 1999, January 2000 right after we launched, there was a sense that these were all, it was such a small\nmarket, it was terrible, we thought these were terrible customers to have, it's just people selling junk on the internet, why\nin the world we want to be going after this market?\nBut there was a way to get a product that was much better for everybody in that market, and we got to something like\ntwenty five, thirty percent market penetration in two or three months, and you've got some walk in to brand recognition,\nand are able to build the business from there. So I always think these very small markets are quite underrated. The\nFacebook version of this I always give is that if the initial market at Facebook was ten thousand people at Harvard, it went\nfrom zero to sixty percent market share in ten days, that was a very auspicious start. The way this gets analyzed in\nbusiness schools is always, that's so ridiculous, it's such a small market, it can't have any value at all. So I think the\nbusiness school analysis of Facebook early on, or of Paypal early on, or of Ebay early on, is that the markets were\nperhaps so small as to have almost no value and that they would've had little value had they they stayed small, but it\nturned out there were ways to grow them concentrically and that's what made them so valuable.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f9e6eb0-0f6c-4f30-9072-1c0a44a540c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f9e6eb0-0f6c-4f30-9072-1c0a44a540c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e12641-de17-4a47-a5ab-628293945fc7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "b105596c2d2c2893d5b3fe9806eefd68b922265a3b2b720f4b5ef2df0c3f98a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7aaaa98-d13f-4d38-80cd-200725b60d0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e062c5021e986474af19450bed2058ddd819ade1e09e78d43ff88b7b04e5c592", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5485551c-3d1d-4fd2-b527-0f1ab899aa98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c0f413a22920b996d36daac85789aa6307931dfce34cb2b2e3d60d4c1377c76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c44443d7e3749d2a9eee42aab7caf914d5692e6e15108ad24a766cef0785f033", "text": "So I always think these very small markets are quite underrated.

You want to be the only player in a small ecosystem. You don\u2019t want to be the\nfourth online pet food company. You don\u2019t want to be the tenth solar panel company. You don\u2019t want to be the hundredth\nrestaurant in Palo Alto. Your restaurant industry is a trillion dollar industry. So if you do a market size analysis, you\nconclude restaurants are fantastic business to go into. And often large existing markets typically means that you have\ntons of competitions so it's very very hard to differentiate. The first very counterintuitive idea is to go after small markets,\nmarkets that are so small people often don't even think that they make sense. That's where you get a foothold and then if\nthose markets are able expand, you can scale into a big monopoly business.\nThere are several different characteristics of these monopoly businesses that I'd like to focus on. There is no single\nformula. In technology there is always a sense that in the history of technology, every moment happens only once. The\nnext Mark Zuckerberg won\u2019t build a social network and the next Larry Page won\u2019t be building a search engine, and the\nnext Bill Gates won\u2019t be building an operating system. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.\nThere are always very unique businesses that are doing something that has not been done before and end up having the\npotential to be a monopoly. The opening line in Anna Karenina, that all happy families are alike and all unhappy families\nare unhappy in their own special way, is not true in business, where I think all happy companies are different because\nthey're doing something very unique. All unhappy companies are alike because they failed to escape the essential\nsameness in competition.\nOne characteristic of a monopoly technology company is some sort of proprietary technology. My sort of crazy, somewhat\narbitrary rule of thumb is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing. So\nAmazon had over ten times as many books, it may not have been that high tech, but you figure oh well it can sell ten\ntimes as many books and be more efficient along the way. In the case of PayPal, Bill Turner was using checks to send\nmoney on Ebay, it took seven to ten days to clear, and PayPal could do it more than ten times as fast. You want to have\nsome sort of very powerful improvement, some order of magnitude improvement, on some key dimension. Of course, if\nyou just come with something totally new, it's just like an infinite improvement. I would say the iPhone was the first smart\nphone that worked, it may not be in fact, but it's so definitely an order of magnitude of an improvement. So I think the\ntechnology needs to be designed to give you a massive delta over the next the next best thing.\nI think there often are network effects that can kick in and that really help the thing and these are linked to monopolies\nover time, the thing that is very tricky about network effects is they're often very hard to get started and so you know\neveryone understands how valuable they are. There's always this incredibly tricky question: why is it valuable to the first\nperson who's doing something. Economies of scale, if you have something with very high fixed costs and very low\nmarginal costs, that's typically a monopoly-like business.\nAnd then there is this thing of branding which is sort of this idea that gets lodged into people's brains. I never quite\nunderstand how branding works, so I never invest in companies where it\u2019s just about branding but it is, I think, a real\nphenomenon that creates real value. I think one of the things, I'm going to come back to this in a little bit, towards the end,\nbut one of the things that\u2019s very striking is that software businesses are often, are for some reason, very good at some of\nthese things. They are especially good at the economies of scale part because the marginal cost of software is zero. So if\nyou get something that works in software it's often significantly better than the existing solution and then you have these\ntremendous economies of scale and you can scale fairly quickly.\nSo even if the market starts small, you can grow your business quickly enough to stay at the same size as the growing\nmarket and maintain the monopoly of power.

Now the critical thing about these monopolies is it's not enough to have a\nmonopoly for just a moment. The critical thing is have one that lasts over time and so in Silicon Valley there is always this\nsort of idea that you want to be the first mover and I always think in some ways the better framing is you want to be the last\nmover. You want to be one of the last companies in that category, those are the ones that are really valid. Microsoft was\nthe last operating system, at least for many decades. Google was the last search engine. Facebook will be valuable if it\nturns out to be the last of social networking site.\nAnd one way to think of this last mover value is this idea that most of the value in these companies exists far in the future.\nIf you do a discounted cash flow analysis of the business, you'll look at all these profit streams, you have a growth rate,\nthe growth rate\u2019s much higher that the discount rate and so most of the value exists far in the future.

So if\nyou are trying to analyze any of the tech companies in Silicon Valley, AirBnB, Twitter, Facebook, any emerging Internet\ncompanies, all the ones in Y Combinator, the math tells you that three quarters, eighty-five percent of the value is coming\nfrom cash flows in years 2024 and beyond. It's very far in the future and so one of the things that we always over value in\nSilicon Valley is growth rates and we undervalue durability.\nGrowth is something you can measure in the here and now, you can always track that very precisely. The question of\nwhether a company will be around a decade from now, that\u2019s actually what dominates the value equation and that\u2019s a\nmuch more qualitative sort of a thing. And so if we went back to this idea of these characteristics of monopoly, the\nproprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, you can think of these characteristics as ones that exist at a\nmoment in time where you capture a market and take it over but you also want to think about, are these things going to\nlast over time. So there\u2019s a time dimension to all these characteristics. So networks in fact often have a great time element\nwhere as the network scales, network effects actually get more robust, and so if you have a network business it's often\none that can become a bigger and stronger monopoly over time.\nProprietary technology is always a little bit of a tricky one, so you want something that is an order of magnitude better than\nthe state of the art in the world today. That's how you get people's attention, that's how you initially break through. But then\nyou don't want to be superseded by somebody else. So there are all these areas of innovation where there was\ntremendous innovation, but no one made any money. So disk drive manufacturing in the 1980's, you could build a better\ndisk drive than anybody else, you could take over the whole world and two years later someone else would come along\nand replace yours. In the course of fifteen years, you got vastly improved disk drives, so had a great benefit to consumers,\nbut it didn't actually help the people who started these companies.\nThere's always this question about having a huge breakthrough in technology, but then also being able to explain why\nyours will be the last breakthrough or at least the last breakthrough for a long time or if you make a breakthrough, then\nyou can keep improving on it at quick enough pace that no one can ever catch up. So if you have a structure of the future\nwhere there's a lot of innovation and other people will come up with new things and the thing you're working on, that's\ngreat for society. It's actually not that good for your business typically. And then economies of scale we\u2019ve already about. I\nthink this last mover thing is very critical. I\u2019m always tempted, I don't want to overdo chess analogies, but the first mover in\nchess is someone who plays white, white is about a one-third of a pawn advantage, so there is a small advantage to\ngoing first. You want to be the last mover who wins the game, so there\u2019s always world chess champion Capablanca line,\n\u201cYou must begin by studying the end game.\u201d I wouldn't say that\u2019s the only thing you should study, I think perspective of\nasking these questions, why will this still be the leading company in ten, fifteen, twenty years from now, is a really critical\none to try to think through.\nI want to go in two slightly other directions with this the monopoly versus competition idea. I think this is the central idea\non my mind for business, for starting a business, for thinking about them. There are some very interesting perspectives, I\nthink it gives, on the whole history of innovation in technology and science.

So I think\nthere is a whole history of science and technology that can be told from the perspective of how much value was actually\ncaptured. Certainly there are entire sectors where people didn't capture anything.\nYou're the smartest physicist of the twentieth century, you come up with special relativity, you come up with general\nrelativity, you don't get to be a billionaire, you don't even get to be a millionaire. It just somehow doesn't work that way.\nThe railroads were incredibly valuable, they mostly just went bankrupt because there was too much competition. Wright\nbrothers, you fly the first plane, you don't make any money. So I think there is a structure to these industries that\u2019s very\nimportant.\nI think the thing that's actually rare are the success cases. So if you really think about the history in this and this two\nhundred fifty years sweep, why is almost always zero percent, it's always zero in science, it's almost always in technology.\nIt's very rare where people made money. You know in the late eighteenth, early nineteenth century, the first industrial\nrevolution was the textile mills, you got the steam engine, you sort of automated things. You had these relentless\nimprovements that people improved efficiency of textile factories, of manufacturing generally, at a clip of five to seven\npercent every year, year after year, decade after decade. You had sixty, seventy years of tremendous improvement from\n1780 to 1850. Even in 1850, most of the wealth in Britain was still held by the landed aristocracy and the workers didn't\nmake that much. The capitalists didn't make that much either, it was all competed away. There were hundreds of people\nrunning textile factories, it was an industry where the structure of the competition prevented people from making any\nmoney.\nThere are, in my mind, probably only two broad categories in the entire history of the last two hundred and fifty years\nwhere people actually came up with new things and made money doing so. One is these sort of vertically integrated\ncomplex monopolies which people did build in the second industrial revolution at the end of the nineteenth and start of\nthe twentieth century. This is like Ford, it was the vertically integrated oil companies like Standard Oil, and what these\nvertically integrated monopolies typically required was a very complex coordination, you've got a lot of pieces to fit\ntogether in just the right way, and when you assemble that you had a tremendous advantage. This is actually done\nsurprisingly little today and so I think this is sort of a business form that when people can pull it off, is very valuable.\nIt's typically fairly capital intensive, we live in a culture where it's very hard to get people to buy into anything that's super\ncomplicated and takes very long to build. When I think of my colleague and friend Elon from PayPal success with Tesla\nand SpaceX, I think the key to these companies was the complex vertically integrated monopoly structure they had. If you\nlook at Tesla or SpaceX and you ask, was there sort of a single breakthrough, I mean they certainly innovated on a law of\ndimensions, but I don't think there was a single 10X breakthrough on battery storage, they may be working on some\nthings in rocketry, but there was no sort of single massive breakthrough. But what was really impressive was integrating\nall these pieces together and doing it in a way that was more vertically integrated than most other competitors.\nSo Tesla also integrated the car distributors so they wouldn't steal all the money as has happened with the rest of the car\nindustry in the US.

They\u2019re doing it for charitable reasons and that you're not a good scientist if you\u2019re\nmotivated by money. I'm not even saying people should always be motivated by money or something like this, but I think\nwe should wish to be a little bit more critical of this as a rationalization. We should ask is this a rationalization to obscure\nthe fact that \"Y\" equals zero percent and the scientists are operating in this sort of world where all the innovation is\neffectively competed away and they can\u2019t capture any of it directly.\nThe software distortion that often happens is because people are making such vast fortunes in software, we infer that this\nis the most valuable thing in the world being done full stop. And so people at Twitter make billions of dollars, it must be\nthat Twitter is worth far more than anything Einstein did. What that realization tends to obscure, is again that \"X\" and \"Y\"\nare independent variables and that there are these businesses where you capture a lot of X and others where you don't.\nSo I do think the history of innovation has been this history where the microeconomics, the structure of these industries\nhas mattered a tremendous amount and there is sort of this story where some people made vast fortunes because they\nworked in industries with the right structure and other people made nothing at all because they were in these very\ncompetitive things.\nWe shouldn't just rationalize that way. I think it's worth understanding this better. Then finally, let me come back to this sort\nof overarching theme for this talk, this competition is for losers idea, which is always a provocative way to title things\nbecause we always think of the losers as the people who are not good at competing. We think of losers as the people\nwho are slow on the track team in high school or do a little less well on standardized tests, and don't get into the right\nschools. So we always think of losers as people who can't compete and I want us to really rethink and re-value this and\nconsider whether it's possible the competition itself is off.\nIt's not just the case we don't understand this monopoly-competition dichotomy intellectually. So we\u2019ve been talking about\nwhy you wouldn\u2019t understand it intellectually, because people lie about it, it\u2019s distorted, the history of innovation\nrationalizes it in all these very strange ways. I think it's more than just an intellectual blind spot, but also a psychological\nblind spot, where we find ourselves very attracted to competition and in one form or another we find it reassuring if other\npeople do things. The word ape, already in the time of Shakespeare, meant both primate and imitate and that is\nsomething about human nature, it's deeply imitative, ape like, sheep like and this is very problematic thing that we need\nto always think through and try to overcome.\nThere is always this question about competition as a form of validation, where we go for things that lots of other people\nare going for. It's not that there is wisdom of crowds, it's not that lots of people trying to do something is the best proof of\nthat being valuable. I think it's when lots of people are trying to do something, that is often proof of insanity. There are\ntwenty thousand people a year who move to Los Angeles to become movie stars, about twenty of them make it. I think the\nOlympics are a little bit better because you have, you can sort of figure out pretty quickly whether you\u2019re good or not, so\nthere's little less of a deadweight loss to society. You know the sort of educational experience that at a place, the pre-\nStanford educational experience, there is always sort of a non-competitive characterization. I think most of the people in\nthis room had machine guns and they were competing with people with bows and arrows, so it wasn\u2019t exactly a parallel\ncompetition when you were in junior high school, in high school. There is always the question: does the tournament\nmake sense as you keep going?\nThere is always this question if people going on to grad school or post doctoral educations, does the intensity of the\ncompetition really make sense. There is the classic Henry Kissinger line describing his fellow faculty at Harvard, \u201cThe\nbattles were so ferocious because the stakes were so small,\u201d describing academia and you sort of think on one level this\nis a description of insanity.

That's often more imaginary than real. There is always sort of a personal version of this I tell, where\nI was sort of hypertracked.

But so much of\npeople's identities got wrapped up in winning these competitions that they somehow lost sight of what was important,\nwhat was valuable. Competition does make you better at whatever it is that you're competing at because when you're\ncompeting you're comparing yourself with the people around you. I\u2019m figuring out how to beat the people next to me, how\ndo I do somewhat better than whatever it is they're doing and you will get better at that. I'm not questioning that, I'm not\ndenying that, but there often comes this tremendous price that you stop asking some bigger questions about what's truly\nimportant and truly valuable. Don't always go through the tiny little door that everyone's trying to rush through, maybe go\naround the corner and go through the vast gate that nobody is taking.\nQ: Do you have any ways to determine the difference [between a monopoly and a non monopoly] when looking at an\nidea or thinking about your own idea?\nA: I would say the question I always focus on is what is the actual market? So not what's the narrative of the market,\nbecause you can always tell a fictional story about a market: it's much bigger much or smaller, but what is the real\nobjective market. So you always try to figure it out, and you realize people have incentives to powerfully distort these\nthings.\nQ: So which of the aspects, of all these you mentioned, you would you say is applicable to Google?\nA: Well, they have they have network effects with the ad network, they had proprietary technology that gave them the\ninitial lead because they had the page rank algorithm, which was an order of magnitude better than any other search\nengine. They had economies of scale up because of the need to store all these different sites, and at this point you have\nbrand, so Google has all four. Maybe the proprietary technology is somewhat weaker at this point but definitely it had all\nfour, and maybe three and a half out of four now.\nQ: How does this apply to Palantir and Square?\nA: That's sort of a set of companies that are doing different copycat payment systems, on mobile phones, there's Square,\nthere's PayPal, they have different shapes that's how they differentiate themselves, one is a triangle, one is a square.\nMaybe at one point the apes run out of shapes or something like that, but at Palantir we started with a focus on the\nintelligence community, which is a small submarket. We had a proprietary technology that used a very different approach\nwhere it was focused on the human computer synthesis, rather than the substitution, which I think is the dominant\nparadigm. So, there is a whole set of things, I would say, on the market approach and on the proprietary technology.\nQ: What do you think about lean startups?\nA: So the question is what do I think about lean startups and iterative thinking where you get feedback from people versus\ncomplexity that may not work.\nI'm personally quite skeptical of all the lean startup methodology. I think the really great companies did something that\nwas somewhat more of a quantum improvement that really differentiated them from everybody else. They typically did not\ndo massive customer surveys, the people who ran these companies sometimes, not always, suffered from mild forms of\nAspergers, so they were not actually that influenced, not that easily deterred, by what other people told them to do. I do\nthink we're way too focused on iteration as a modality and not enough on trying to have a virtual ESP link with the public\nand figuring it out ourselves.\nI would say the risk question is always a very tricky one, because it's often the case that you don't have enough time to\nreally mitigate risk. If you're going to take enough time to figure out what people want, you often will have missed the boat\nby then. And then of course there is always the risk of doing something that's not that significant or meaningful. You could\nsay that a track in law school is a low risk track from one perspective, but it may still be a very high risk track in the sense\nthat maybe you have a high risk of not doing something meaningful with your life. We have to think about risk in these\nvery complicated ways. I think risk is this complicated concept.\nQ: Doesn't the last mover advantage already imply that there's competition to begin with?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4405, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23b6810e-09ac-48c8-94ed-283326d32989": {"__data__": {"id_": "23b6810e-09ac-48c8-94ed-283326d32989", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "523b7db4-0f86-4021-9b08-59842c429a2a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1a3289f49aafe912c8c35a269c365ec02b947ff0317449ae77c9872d4fe84d07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b91b3c31-af5f-46d1-a1e2-0d0b496ccd99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e5dd007327221a4a455a5ab790886b5f210cc1a091a7ef3c18bf9efae522171e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9461bf36-390c-463e-a985-e906bc234776", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "842c982c20f290933ebfcab59d1e4bb1f3ac59246dc89f9420aaef9885c43ad6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "08dcf14e9e8552fe96e14d3d585fe9fd9ca1dce3316636f2da1c1c3e5a792562", "text": "A: Yes, there's always a terminology thing. I would say that there are categories in which people sort of are bundled\ntogether. The monopoly business, I think they really were a big first mover. In some sense you can say Google was not\nthe first search engine, there were search engines before. But on one dimension they were dramatically better than\neverybody else. They were the first one with page rank, with an automated approach. Facebook was not the first of social\nnetworking site. My friend, Reid Hoffman, started one in 1997, they called it Social Net, so they already had the name\nsocial networking in the name of their company seven years before Facebook. Their idea was that it going to be this\nvirtual cyberspace were I'd be a dog and you'd be a cat and we'd have all these different rules about how we interact with\neach other in this virtual alternate reality. Facebook was the first one to get real identity, so I hope Facebook will be the\nlast social networking site. It was the first one in a very important dimension, people often would not think of it as the first\nbecause they sort of lump all these things together.\nQ: If someone worked at Goldman Sachs out of college and left after six months and is now studying CS at Stanford, how\nwould you recommend rethinking their competitive advantage?\nA: I am not great at the psychotherapy stuff, so I don't quite know how to solve this. There are these very odd studies they\nhave done on people who go to business school, this one was done at the Harvard Business School where it's sort of the\nanti-Asbergers personality, where people are super extroverted, generally have low convictions, few ideas and you have\nsort of a hothouse environment you put all these people and for two years and at the end of it, they systematically end up,\nthe largest cohort systematically ends up doing the wrong thing, they try to catch the last wave. in 1999 everyone tried to\nwork with Mike Milken, this was a few years before he went to jail for all the junk bond stuff.\nThey were never interested in Silicon Valley or tech except for 1999, 2000 when they timed the dotcom bubble peaking\nperfectly. 2005 to 2007 was housing, private equity, stuff like this. This tendency for us to see competition as validation is\nvery deep, I don't think there's some easy psychological formula to avoid this. I don't quite know how what sort of therapy\nto recommend.\nMy first starting point, which is only going to be maybe ten percent of the way, is to never underestimate how big a\nproblem it is.

And now,\nyou\u2019re stuck with me. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\nUnlike Paul when he was talking in the Q&A and you guys asked him what he\u2019d do if he was in college today and he said\nphysics, I actually indulged myself. I went and did physics at Cambridge. I think physics is an amazing class to give you\ntransferable skills that are really useful in other areas, but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re listening to me today; physics isn\u2019t the\nclass.\nSo I paid for college doing online marketing, directions marketing. I started with SEO in the 1990s. I created a paper\nairplane site, and had a monopoly in the small niche market of paper airplanes. When you want to start a startup also see\nhow big the market could be. (In the long term, it wasn\u2019t great.) But what that taught me was how to do SEO. And back in\nthose days it was Alta Vista, and the way to do SEO was to have white text, on a white background, five pages below the\nfold, and you would rank top of Alta Vista if you just said planes 20 or 30 times in that text. And that was how you won\nSEO in the 1990s. It was a really, really easy skill to learn.\nWhen I went to college, being a physicist, I thought paper airplanes would make me cool. I was actually the nerdiest\nperson in the physics class, so I created a cocktail site, which was how I learned to program and that grew to be the\nlargest cocktail site in the UK. That really got me into SEO properly when Google launched. So with Google you had to\nworry about page rank and getting links back to your site, which basically at that stage meant one link from the Yahoo\ndirectory, got you to the top listing in Google if you had white text and a white background below the fold as well.\nWhen Google launched AdWords, that\u2019s really when I started to do all my marketing. That meant buying paid clicks from\nGoogle and reselling them to eBay for a small margin of like 20% using their affiliate program. That was what really\nkicked me into overdrive, into doing what everyone nowadays talks about as growth, growth hacking or growth marketing.\nIn my mind it\u2019s just internet marketing using whatever channel you can to get whatever output you want, and that\u2019s how I\npaid for college and that\u2019s how I went from being a physicist to a Marketer - transitioning to the darkside of the force.\nSo what do you think matters most for growth? You\u2019ve had tons of lectures, and people have said it over and over, so\nwhat do you guys think matters most for growth?\nAudience: Great product.\nSchultz: What does a great product lead to?\nAudience: Customers.\nSchultz: And what do you need those customers to do?\nAudience: Spread the word.\nSchultz: Yes that\u2019s it, retention. Retention is the single most important thing for growth. Now we have an awesome growth\nteam at Facebook and I\u2019m super proud to work in it, but the truth of the matter is, we have a fantastic product. Getting to\nwork on growth of Facebook is a massive privilege because we are promoting something that everyone in the world\nreally wants to use, which is absolutely incredible. If we can get people on, and get them ramped up, they stick on\nFacebook.\nSo many times, I got to advise multiple startups. My favorite was working with Airbnb, but I\u2019ve worked with Coursera, I\u2019ve\nworked with other ones that haven\u2019t done as well as those guys. But the one thing that\u2019s true, over and over again is, if\nLecture 6: Growth\nAlex Schultz", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3486, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c818843-c5de-4f9f-abb6-6de494b804ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c818843-c5de-4f9f-abb6-6de494b804ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5152bed9-df1c-48a9-ae6e-0e68e2cb2404", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6998cbcc60b1fec2c6250d90ac4426ce07e7026d123dfd1c212461164ff9bd4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9461bf36-390c-463e-a985-e906bc234776", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "842c982c20f290933ebfcab59d1e4bb1f3ac59246dc89f9420aaef9885c43ad6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51e92e5c-3763-49b8-8515-ac2cbda506f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c8cd2e134b8ba883733ca923c1b18dedf7ada3b6a8fb51e630f0841128e89e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9aa65c36930b7fe2d0e11b27832eb615dd4c03bc7ec105eb45e897d639b42e3d", "text": "you look at this curve, \u2018percent monthly active\u2019 versus \u2018number of days from acquisition\u2019, if you end up with a retention\ncurve that is asymptotic to a line parallel to the X-axis, you have a viable business and you have product market fit for\nsome subset of market. But most of the companies that you see fly up, we\u2019ve talked about packing and virality and all of\nthis stuff, their retention curve slopes down toward the axis, and in the end, intercepts the X-axis.\nNow when I show this job to people, they say that\u2019s all well and good, you had a million people a day in terms of growth,\nwhen you started the growth team at Facebook, or \u2018you were at 50 million users, you had a lot of people join your site so\nyou had a ton of data to do this.\u2019 We used the same methodology for our B2B growth , getting people to sign-up for\nservices advertisements, we used this to understand how much growth we were going to have in that market as well. And\nat that point when I joined Facebook, the product was three days old. And within 90 days of the product launching, we\nwere able to use this technique to figure out what the one year value of an advertiser was, and we predicted it for the first\nyear to 97%. So I think it\u2019s very important to look at your retention curve.\nIf you see here, this red line is the \u2018number of users\u2019 who have been on your product for a certain number of days. So a\nbunch of people, will have been on the product at least one day, but if your product has been around for a year, you\u2019ll\nhave zero users who have been on it for 366 days. Make sense?\nSo what you then do is look for all of your users who have been on your product one day. What percentage of them are\nmonthly active? 100% for the first 30 days obviously, because monthly active, they also end up on one day. But then you\nlook at 31. Every single user on their 31st day after registration, what percentage of them are monthly active? Thirty-\nsecond day, thirty-third day, thirty-fourth day. And that allows you, with only 10,000 customers, to get a real idea of what\nthis curve is going to look like for your product. And you\u2019re going to be able to tell, is it asymptotic? It\u2019ll get noisy towards\nthe right side, like I\u2019 m not using real data, but you\u2019ll be able to get a handle on, whether this curve flattens out or does it\nnot. If it doesn\u2019t flatten out, don\u2019t go into growth tactics, don\u2019t do virality, don\u2019t hire a growth hacker. Focus on getting\nproduct market fit, because in the end, as Sam said in the beginning of this course: idea, product, team, execution. If you\ndon\u2019t have a great product, there\u2019s no point in executing more on growing it because it won\u2019t grow. Number one problem\nI\u2019ve seen, inside Facebook for new products, number one problem I\u2019ve seen for startups, is they don\u2019t actually have\nproduct market fit, when they think they do.\nSo the next question that people ask over and over again is, what does good retention look like? Sure! I can have 5%\nretention, but I\u2019m guessing Facebook had better than that. That\u2019s not going to be a successful business. I get really pissed\noff when people ask me that question, because I think you can figure it out. I love this story; this is like my one gratuitous\nstory (link on powerpoint) that I\u2019m throwing out here, so the rest of it may not be as gratuitous. But this is a picture that was\npublished in Life Magazine in 1950 of one of the Trinity nuclear bomb tests. There\u2019s a guy named Jeffrey Taylor.

If we signed everyone on the\ninternet up, then you will know it\u2019s higher than that. Similarly, if you look at WhatsApp. They\u2019ve announced 600 million\nactive users. How many people have Smart Phones? You can figure out that number - that number is out knocking\naround. It can give you an idea of how many users there are. Amazon has a had a pop at signing up almost everyone in\nthe United States. You know how many people are online in the United States, and you have a good idea of how many\ncustomers Amazon has from the numbers they throw out. Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for\nthem to have successful businesses. If you\u2019re on ecommerce and you\u2019re retaining on a monthly active basis, like 20 to\n30% of your users, you\u2019re going to do very well. If you\u2019re on social media, and the first batch of people signing up to your\nproduct are not like, 80% retained, you\u2019re not going to have a massive social media site. So it really depends on the\nvertical you\u2019re in, what the retention rates are. What you need to do is have the tools to think, \u2018who out there is\ncomparable\u2019 and how you can look at it and say, \u2018am I anywhere close to what real success looks like in this vertical?\u2019\nRetention is the single most important thing for growth and retention comes from having a great idea and a great product\nto back up that idea, and great product market fit. The way we look at, whether a product has great retention or not, is\nwhether or not the users who install it, actually stay on it long-term, when you normalize on a cohort basis, and I think\nthat\u2019s a really good methodology for looking at your product and say \u2018okay the first 100, the first 1,000, the first 10,000\npeople I get on this, will they be retained in the long-run?\nSo now, how do you attack operating for growth? Let\u2019s say you have awesome product market fit. You\u2019ve built an\necommerce site, and you have 60% of people coming back every single month, and making a purchase from you, which\nwould be absolutely fantastic. How do you then take that, and say, \u2018now it\u2019s time to scale.\u2019 (Now it\u2019s time to execute was\nthe last thing on your forum right? \nto moderator\n.) That\u2019s where I think growth teams come in.\nMy contrarian viewpoint is, if you're a startup, you shouldn't have a growth team. Startups should not have growth teams.\nThe whole company should be the growth team. The CEO should be the head of growth. You need someone to set a\nNorth star for you about where the company wants to go, and that person needs to be the person leading the company,\nfrom my opinion, that's what I've seen. Mark is a fantastic example of that. Back when Facebook started, a lot of people\nwere putting out their registered user numbers. Right? You'd see you registered user numbers for MySpace, you'd see a\nregistered user numbers for ___11:38, you'd see registered user numbers. Mark put out monthly active users, as the\nnumber both internally he held everyone to, and said we need everyone on Facebook, but that means everyone active\non Facebook, not everyone signed up on Facebook, so monthly active people was the number internally, and it was also\nthe number he published externally. It was the number he made the whole world hold Facebook to, as a number that we\ncared about. If you look at what Jan has done with WhatsApp I think that's another great example. He always published\nsends numbers.\nIf you\u2019re a messaging application, sends is probably the single most important number. If people use you once a day,\nmaybe that\u2019s great, but you\u2019re not really their primary messaging mechanism, so Jan published the sends number. Inside\nAirbnb, they talk about \u2018nights booked\u2019 and also published that in all of the infographics you see in side TechCrunch.\nThey always benchmark themselves against how many nights booked they have compared to the largest hotel chains in\nthe world. They have at each of these companies, a different north star. The north star doesn\u2019t have to be the number of\nactive users for every different vertical.

Every different company when it thinks about growth, needs a different North star; however, when you are\noperating for growth it is critical that you have that North star, and you define as a leader.\nThe reason this matters is, the second you have more than one person working on something, you cannot control what\neveryone else is doing. I promise you, having now hit 100 people I\u2019m managing, I have no control. It\u2019s all influence. It\u2019s\nlike I tell one person to do one thing, but the other 99 are going to do whatever they want. And the thing is, it\u2019s not clear to\neverybody what the most important thing is for a company. It would be very easy for people inside eBay to say, \u2018you know\nwhat? we should focus on revenue,\u2019 or \u2018we should focus on the number of people buying from us\u2019 or \u2018we should focus on\nhow many people list items on eBay.\u2019 And Pierre, and Meg, and John, those guys as various leaders, have always said", "start_char_idx": 3345, "end_char_idx": 5576, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "766f1691-eadf-4546-92d3-e11d78de3428": {"__data__": {"id_": "766f1691-eadf-4546-92d3-e11d78de3428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93623816-587e-404c-a4b0-643b0f54842a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1065730bc427062b7c4eb2ceec6f7a784730e9cb98be42a76b0c58c75e930347", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "573269d5-cb93-4801-8484-040700cace7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "4694e590cc8541c942905bac2919780fc9b9bcbfded3e36b49e256b527cfebee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "72b8437f-ae92-4148-8562-43c7aac791aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5c9dab4ebc44648524872066dbe4428a04fe5ff63348c604dbab845be9c39ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6d530ce1da945bcd44e04bfa885d9d390bd89d4fc41714541d52d8791a2b8fe3", "text": "\u2018no, its the amount of Gross Merchandise Volume that goes through our site, the percentage of e-commerce that goes\nthrough our site, that is what really matters for this company. This means that when someone is having a conversation\nand you\u2019re not in the room, or when they\u2019re sitting in front of their computer screens, and thinking about how they built this\nparticular project or this particular feature, in their head it\u2019s going to be clear to them that it\u2019s not about revenue, it\u2019s about\nGross Merchandise Volume, or it\u2019s not about getting more registrations, registrations don\u2019t matter, unless they become\nlong-term active users. A great example of this was when I was at eBay in 2004, we changed they way we paid our\naffiliates for new users. Affiliate programs are a bit out of fashion these days, but the idea of an affiliate program is\nessentially, you pay anyone on the internet a referral for sending traffic to your site, but it\u2019s mostly about getting access to\nbig marketers who do it on their own.\nWe were paying for confirmed registered users, so all of our affiliates were lined up on getting confirmed registered users\nto the eBay site. We changed our payment model to pay for activated confirmed registered users. So you had to confirm\nyour account and then bid on an item, or buy or list an item, to become someone that we paid for. Overnight when we\nmade that change, we lost something like 20% of confirmed registered users that were being driven by the affiliates. But\nthe ACRUs (15:45) only dropped by about 5%. The ratio between CRU to ACRU went up, and then, the growth of ACRUs\nmassively accelerated. The cause of this is, if you want to drive CRU, if someone searches for a trampoline, you land\nthem on the registration page because they link you have to register and confirm before they get their trampoline. If you\nwant to drive ACRUs, you land them on the search results page, within eBay for trampolines, so they can see the thing\nthey want to buy, get excited, and then register when they want to buy it. And if you drive just CRUs, people don\u2019t have an\namazing magic moment on eBay, when they visit the site. And that\u2019s the next most important thing to think about: How do\nyou drive to the magic moment that gets people hooked on your service.\nIn the lecture notes for this course, I\u2019ve stuck in a bunch of links to people I think are brilliant at this stuff. For example,\nregarding the retention curve I showed you earlier, there\u2019s a link to this guy Danny Ferante who is incredible talking about\nretention curves. The magic moment there are two videos linked: one is Chamath talking about growth, who is the guy\nwho set up the growth team at Facebook, and the other, is my friend Naomi and I talking at f8 four years about how we\nwere thinking about growth back then. In both of those videos, we talk about the magic moment. What do you think the\nmagic moment is for when you\u2019re signing up to Facebook?\nAudience: See your friends.\nSchultz: See your friends. Simple as that. I\u2019ve talked to so many companies, and they try to get incredibly complicated\nabout what they\u2019re doing, but it is just as simple as when you see the first picture of one of your friends on Facebook, you\ngo \u2018Oh my God, this is what this site is about!\u2019 Zuckerberg talked at Y Combinator about getting people to 10 friends in 14\ndays; that is why we focus on this metric. The number one most important thing in a social media site is connecting to\nyour friends, because without that, you have a completely empty newsfeed, and clearly you\u2019re not going to come back;\nyou\u2019ll never get any notifications, and you\u2019ll never get any friends telling you about things they are missing on the site.\nSo for Facebook the magic moment, is that moment when you see your friend\u2019s face, and everything we do on growth, if\nyou look at the Linkedin registration flow, you look at the Twitter registration flow, or you look at what WhatsApp does\nwhen you sign up, the number one thing all these services look to do, is show you the people you want to follow, connect\nto, send messages to, as quickly as possible, because in this vertical, this is what matters.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4147, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72b8437f-ae92-4148-8562-43c7aac791aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "72b8437f-ae92-4148-8562-43c7aac791aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93623816-587e-404c-a4b0-643b0f54842a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1065730bc427062b7c4eb2ceec6f7a784730e9cb98be42a76b0c58c75e930347", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "766f1691-eadf-4546-92d3-e11d78de3428", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6d530ce1da945bcd44e04bfa885d9d390bd89d4fc41714541d52d8791a2b8fe3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad2bade3-33fb-44a8-bbe3-f0c0a63716d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7d2c1a15ed5ffe79cf480db8e82f75b8c61d35105d55f2348c70ed9acc60e84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f5c9dab4ebc44648524872066dbe4428a04fe5ff63348c604dbab845be9c39ae", "text": "The number one most important thing in a social media site is connecting to\nyour friends, because without that, you have a completely empty newsfeed, and clearly you\u2019re not going to come back;\nyou\u2019ll never get any notifications, and you\u2019ll never get any friends telling you about things they are missing on the site.\nSo for Facebook the magic moment, is that moment when you see your friend\u2019s face, and everything we do on growth, if\nyou look at the Linkedin registration flow, you look at the Twitter registration flow, or you look at what WhatsApp does\nwhen you sign up, the number one thing all these services look to do, is show you the people you want to follow, connect\nto, send messages to, as quickly as possible, because in this vertical, this is what matters.

My favorite example is notifications. Again, I\u2019ve talked to and advised many different companies; every single\ncompany when they talk about notifications goes \u2018Oh, I\u2019m getting too many notifications, I think that\u2019s what we have to\noptimize for on notifications.\u2019 Okay, are your power users leaving your site because they\u2019re getting too many\nnotifications? No. Then why would you optimize that? They\u2019re probably grown-ups and they can use filters.\nWhat you need to focus on is the marginal user. The one person who doesn\u2019t get a notification in a given day, month, or\nyear. Building an awesome product is all about think about the power user, right? Building an incredible product is\ndefinitely optimizing it for the people who use your product the most, but when it comes to driving growth, people who are\nalready using your product are not the ones you have to worry about. So in this Danny Ferante video there\u2019s also talk\nabout our growth accounting framework that we use to think about for growth. We looked at new users, resurrected users\n(people who weren\u2019t on Facebook for 30 days and came back) and churned users. The resurrected and churned\nnumbers for pretty much every product I\u2019ve ever seen dominate the new user account once you reach a sensible point of\ngrowth a few years in. And all those users who are churning and resurrecting, had low friend counts, and didn\u2019t find their\nfriends so weren\u2019t connected to the great stuff that was going on on Facebook. So the number one thing we needed to\nfocus on, was getting them to those 10 friends, or whatever number of friends they needed. So think about the user on the\nmargin; don\u2019t think about where yourself (21:08), when you\u2019re thinking about growth.\nSo for operating for growth, what you really need to think about, is what is the North star of your company: What is that\none metric, where if everyone in your company is thinking about it and driving their product towards that metric and their\nactions towards moving that metric up, you know in the long-run your company will be successful. By the way, they\u2019re all\nprobably all correlated to each other, so it\u2019s probably fine to pick almost any metric, whichever one you feel the best\nabout, that aligns with your mission and your values - probably go for that one. But realistically, daily active users fairly\ncorrelate to monthly active users; we could have gone with either one. Amount of content shared, also correlates with\nhow many users there are, because guess what? You add a user, they share content. So a lot of things end up being\ncorrelated. Pick the one that fits with you and know that you\u2019re going to stick with for a long time. Just have a North Star,\nand know the magic moment that you know when a user experiences that, they will deliver on that metric for you on the\nNorth Star, and then think about the marginal user, don\u2019t think about yourself. Those are, I think, the most important points\nwhen operating for growth. Everything has to come from the top.\nSo the last area is tactics. So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve found your niche market that you\u2019re going to have a monopoly on inside the\nmousetrap market. It\u2019s a silenced mousetrap fir sitting under beds, so if that the mice come to your bed overnight, they can\nbe killed without waking you up. That\u2019s your niche market. Your mousetrap is better than anybody else for that market.\nWhat typically happens in Silicon Valley is, everyone thinks marketers are useless. I thought marketers were useless\nwhen I was a Physics student, so I\u2019m sure that you guys as Engineering students you must think that we\u2019re awful people\nwho aren\u2019t useful to have around.\n\u2018Build it and they will come.\u2019 That is something that is very much the mantra in the Valley, and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true; I\nbelieve you actually have to work. There\u2019s a good article in the lecture page from interviewing Ben Silverman. We talked\nabout how the growth of Pinterest was driven by marketing.

Famously ? (23:55) had Fakebook.css in their HTML, and there were a ton of sites\nlike that out there, whether it was ?, a clear clone, Mixie, Cyworld, Orkut; they were all these different social networks\naround the world that grew up when Facebook was focused around the U.S. Internationalizing was an important barrier\nwe needed to knock down, and knocking down barriers is often important to think about for growth. Facebook started out\nas college-only, so every college that it was launched in was knocking down a barrier. When Facebook expanded\nbeyond colleges to high schools, I wasn\u2019t at the company, but that was a company-shaking moment where people\nquestioned whether or not Facebook would survive,if the culture of the site could survive.\nThen after, expanding from high schools to everyone - that was just before I joined - it was a shocking moment; that\u2019s", "start_char_idx": 3403, "end_char_idx": 5272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed9444c9-958b-4eb9-8e3c-6632059a1753": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed9444c9-958b-4eb9-8e3c-6632059a1753", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee275cd-f8ee-4ff9-a767-94c867d8c190", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a330ca24609a5a37552a3f3e53214f23f58269cdb7fe4fe60f96222a735aadfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4d5e047-2de4-4b89-8580-a361134d81b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "90ae43c6d38004935cd5630f2061153c2d117e81e5f82a10391cfa297d522138", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "191212a3-494d-4e10-96a8-10682ae4e32a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1d04dcfd36d7d95e05201d12de731de414b2d8a0c320674e902eb9d8f6c471a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "afaab97306115ab238e18764e6e6e0238b3090b3e31aab953680b644a06df932", "text": "what spurred the growth up to 50 million, and then we hit a brick wall. When we hit that brick wall, that was when a lot of\nexistential questions were being asked inside Facebook whether any social network could ever get to more than 100\nmillion users. It sounds stupid now, but at that time, no one had ever achieved it. Everyone had tapped out between 50\nand 100 million users, and we were worried that it wasn\u2019t possible. That was the point at which the growth team got set\nup; Chamath brought a bunch of us together. He said very publicly he wanted to fire me on multiple occasions. Without\nChamath, I think none of us would have stayed at the company; we were a really weird bunch of people - but it worked\nout. The two things we did, I think that really drove growth initially was, 1) We focused on that 10 friends in 14 days 2)\nGetting users to the magic moment. That was something that Zuck drove because we were all stuck in analysis paralysis\nand, \u2018Is it causation? Is it correlation?\u2019 Zuck would say \u2018You really think that if no one gets a friend, that they\u2019ll be active on\nFacebook? Are you crazy?\u2019\nThe second thing was internationalization - knocking down another barrier. When we launched it, I think there were two\nthings we did really well: 1) Even though we were late (and stressed about being late) we took the time to build it in a\nscalable way; we moved slow to move fast. You can actually view the full story from Naomi on one of the video links from\nthe lecture page. What we did was draw all the strings on the site in FBT, which is our translation extraction script and\nthen, we created the community translation platform, so we didn\u2019t have just professional translators translating the site,\nbut we could have all our users translating the site. We got French translated in 12 hours. We managed to get, to this day,\n104 languages translated by Facebook for Facebook, 70 of those are translated by the community. We took the time to\nbuild something, that would enable us to scale.\nThe other thing is that we prioritized the right languages. Back then, the four main languages were French, Italian,\nGerman, and Spanish (and Chinese, but we are blocked in China). Now look at that list - that\u2019s today\u2019s distribution of\nlanguages. Italian isn\u2019t on the list anymore; French and German are about to fall off. In the last year we quadrupled the\nnumber of people on Facebook in Hindi. Building for what the world is today is an easy mistake to make, and it\u2019s a lot of\nwhat the other social networks did. We built a scalable translation infrastructure that actually enabled us to attack all of\nthe languages, so we could be ready for where the future is going to be. You\u2019ll probably be able to see some of our\nInternet.org summit in India about where we want to go with language translations.\nThese are the tactics I want to go through now: Virality, SEO, ESPN, SEM, Affiliates/referral programs. I think there are two\nways to look at virality. There\u2019s a great book by Adam L. Penenberg called the Viral Loop that goes through a bunch of\ncase studies of companies that have grown through viral marketing. I strongly encourage you to read this book if you\u2019re\ninterested in viral marketing, as well as advertising. I think Ogilvy on Advertising is great as well because in the chapter 7\nyou can't think of anything else stick a car to billboard with super glue and people will buy the super glue. He has some\nreally great creative tips. So virality. Sean Parker has this really great model that he told us about when I joined\nFacebook, which is to think about virality about a product, in terms of three things. First, is payload - so how many people\ncan you hit with any given viral blast. Second, is conversion rate, and third is frequency. This gives you a fundamental\nidea of how viral a product is.\nHotmail is the canonical example of brilliant viral marketing. Back when Hotmail launched, there were a bunch of mail\ncompanies that had been funded and were throwing huge amounts of money at traditional advertising. Back in that time,\npeople couldn\u2019t get free email clients; they had to be tied to their ISP.

Back in that time,\npeople couldn\u2019t get free email clients; they had to be tied to their ISP. Hotmail and a couple other companies launched,\nand their clients were available wherever you went. You could log-in via library internet or school internet, and be able to\nget access to that. It was a really big value proposition for anyone who wanted to access it. Most of the companies went\nout there and did big TV campaigns, billboard campaigns, or newspaper campaigns; however, the Hotmail team didn\u2019t\nhave much funding as they did, so they had to scramble around to figure out how to do it. What they did was add that little\nlink at the bottom of every email that said, \u2018Sent from Hotmail. Get your free email here.\u2019\nThe interesting thing was that it meant that the payload was low: You email one person at a time, you\u2019re not necessarily\ngoing to have a big payload. Maybe you send around one of those spam emails, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d click on your link.\nThe frequency is high though, because you\u2019re emailing the same people over and over, which means you\u2019re going to hit\nthose people once, twice, three times a day and really bring up the impressions.

Paypal is interesting because there are two sides to it, the buyer and the seller side. The\nother thing that is interesting is that its mechanism for viral growth is eBay. So you can use a lot of things for virality that\nmay not look necessarily obviously viral. If you said to a seller that you were going to send them money - I can\u2019t think of a\nhigher conversion rate. Frequency was low, and payload was low. But Paypal did this thing where they gave away\nmoney when you got your friends to sign up, and that\u2019s how they went viral on the consumer side. They didn\u2019t have to do\nthat for sellers, because if I said \u2018I am going to send you money via this,\u2019 you will take that. And even on the consumer\nside they went viral because if someone says \u2018Sign up for this thing and you\u2019ll get ten bucks.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t you? So they\nwere able to go viral because their conversion rate was high on the buyer and the seller side, not because their payload\nand frequency was high. Make sense?\nThis is a really good way to look at virality if you want to say, \u2018Is this product viral?\u2019 Facebook was not viral via email\nsharing or anything like that. Facebook was purely viral via word of mouth. The interesting thing about Paypal and\nHotmail, is to use them, the first person has to send an email to a person who wasn\u2019t on the service. With Facebook, there\nis no native way to contact people who aren\u2019t on the service. Everyone thinks that Facebook is a viral marketing success,\nbut that\u2019s actually not how it grew. It was word of mouth virality because it was an awesome product you wanted to tell\nyour friends about.\nQ: In the first round, it makes sense for there to be a low payload. Will the payload increase in later rounds as the\ncampaign grows and people send more and more e-mails?\nA: First and foremost, I think you only send emails to a small number of people. So compared to the massive viral engines\nthat exist today, where you import someone\u2019s entire contact book and send them all an e-mail, or where you post to\neveryone\u2019s friends on Facebook, the actual payloads are still very small even if it\u2019s everyone that you e-mail on a frequent\nbasis you hit. I\u2019m also thinking per email sent out, how many people are on it. But it\u2019s a fair point that as more people get\non Hotmail, they\u2019ll send more emails, and as more people use email, the product grows more and more successfully.\nQ: Does a point of conversion matter as well?\nA: On Hotmail you click to sign up, but on a billboard you have to remember the URL, go to the website, type it in, find the\nregistration button, click register and sign up. Anything you can do to move friction out of the flow, do it. Going from a\nbillboard ad to an online ad removes huge amounts of friction from the flow.\nQ: Are frequency and conversation rate related?\nA: Absolutely. If you hit someone with the same email over and over again, or the same banner ad, the same rules apply\nto every channel. The more times you hit someone with the same Facebook ad, the less they\u2019ll click. That\u2019s why we have\nto, like creative exhaustion, rotate creatives on Facebook. Same with banner ads and news feed stories. The fiftieth time\nyou see that IQ story on your news feed, you are not going to want to click on it. The same is true with these emails. So if\nyou send the same email to people over and over again with an invite, you will get a lower conversion rate. \u2018The more\nyou hit someone with the same message, the less they convert\u2019 is fundamental across every online marketing channel.\nSecond way to look at virality, which I think is awesome, is by this guy Ed. Ed runs the growth team at Uber now; he was\nat the growth team at Facebook. He was a Stanford MBA student, and did a class similar to this where they talked about\nvirality and built viral products. The interesting thing is, if you look at Uber, they\u2019re incredibly focused on drivers. It\u2019s a two-\nsided market place, so they need drivers. It\u2019s a huge part of their focus as a team, even though they\u2019ve got probably the\nbest viral guy in the world at the company.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4080, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a50537f8-7da4-4a86-8733-d362344dca87": {"__data__": {"id_": "a50537f8-7da4-4a86-8733-d362344dca87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63935552-eb57-499b-98df-f4d5576a1bc3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2f5f1724e96ad49862eae6bc93a1ece9a046cbfc11e4369abc2493ba37c0293e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b86be94-f964-41c0-bf5e-268a72c919be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "da4c6b8391ded7a4aa1a1761eb1216b3e94566d1fa385ca4c23368f55ef596cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2ae8aa1-c2ab-4aff-869f-87b6ee483079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "38d52f529ac7cdfa1d4e96444e26c8ca5ead909933ab06e4c43f35e9c00c7482", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a5e267e32db24ec57dd9d25199161dc1f5d281a56f3d0695e6844b2fdd44666a", "text": "The same is true with these emails.

Then the question is, how many of those people do\nyou get to send imports? Then, to how many people? Then, how many click? How many sign up? And then how many of\nthose import. So essentially you want people to sign up to your site to import their contacts. You want to then get them to\nsend an invite to all of those contacts - ideally all of those contacts, not just some of them. Then you want a percentage of\nthose to click and sign up. If you multiply all the percentages/numbers in every point in between the steps, this is\nessentially how you get to the point of \u2018What is the K factor?\u2019 For example, let\u2019s says 100 people get an invite per person\nwho imports, then of those, 10% click, and 50% sign up, and of those only 10 to 20% import, you\u2019re going to be at 0.5 -", "start_char_idx": 3266, "end_char_idx": 4924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ae8aa1-c2ab-4aff-869f-87b6ee483079": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ae8aa1-c2ab-4aff-869f-87b6ee483079", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "581124a2-cb32-4fcc-8518-7fbc89e2df04", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "3a845b2ae4d371eddcbceca3c8329bce05560d239a479b6d751940e7597d1f4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a50537f8-7da4-4a86-8733-d362344dca87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a5e267e32db24ec57dd9d25199161dc1f5d281a56f3d0695e6844b2fdd44666a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d24a4a8e-726d-45fb-b0e2-3dc605eec2f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55b8bbbfc3bcae160f519c70eaa335f5544ac30417f0d20b52890cc70b7f9cce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "38d52f529ac7cdfa1d4e96444e26c8ca5ead909933ab06e4c43f35e9c00c7482", "text": "1.0 K factor, and you\u2019re not going to be viral. A lot of things like Viddy were very good at pumping up stories. They got the\nfactor over 1, which is perfectly doable. But if you\u2019ve got something that doesn\u2019t have high retention on the backend, it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter. You should look at your invite flow and say \u2018okay, what is my equivalent to import, how many people\nper import are invites sent to, how many of those receive clicks, how many of those convert to my site, how many of those\nthen import,\u2019 in order to get an idea of you K factor. The real important thing is still to think about retention, not so much\nvirality, and only do this after you have a large number of people retained on your product per person who signs up.\nA couple more things we are going to touch on: SEO, emails, SMS, and push notifications.\nIn SEO, there are three things you need to think about. First one is keyword research. People do this badly all the time. So\nI launched this cocktail site I told you about, I spend a year optimizing it to rank for the word cocktail making, but it turns\nout in the UK, no one searches for cocktail making- about 500 a month; I dominated that search, it was awesome! 400\nvisitors a month, it was amazing. Everyone searches for cocktail recipes, and in the U.S., everyone searches for drink\nrecipes. So I optimized for the wrong word. You have to do your research first about what you\u2019re going to go after.\nResearch consists of, what do people search for that\u2019s related to your site, how many people search for it, how many\nother people are ranking for it, and how valuable is it for you? Supply, demand, and value. So, do your keyword research\nto figure out which keyword you want to rank for. There are many great tools out there. Honestly the best one is still\nGoogle AdWords keyword planner tool.\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, the next most important thing is links. Page ranks is essentially how all SEO is driven, and Google\nis based on authority. Now there\u2019s a lot of other things in Google\u2019s algorithm now, like, do people search for your website,\nthere's a lot of stuff about what the distribution of what the anchor text is that\u2019s sent to your site, so that if you abuse it or\nspam it, they can pop out with spam. White text on a white background five pages below the fold doesn't work anymore.\nBut the single most important thing is to get valuable links from high authority websites for you to rank in Google. Then\nyou need to distribute that love inside your site by internally linking effectively. We launched SEO in September 2007; I\njoined Facebook November 2007. When we launched it, but we were getting no traffic from the pages we had launched,\npublic user profiles. So when I went in and looked at it, the only way you could get into any public user profile was to click\non the foot of the page for the about link, then click on the blog articles, then click on one of the authors, and then spider\nout through their friends to get all their friends.\nTurns out that Google was like, \u2018They bury these pages, they\u2019re not very valuable. I\u2019m not going to rank them.\u2019 We made\none change: We added a directory so that Google could quickly get to every page on the site, and we 100Xed SEO traffic.\nVery simple change drove a lot of upside by distributing the link love internally.\nThe last thing is that there\u2019s a whole bunch of table stakes stuff for XML sitemaps, and making sure you have the right\nheaders; it\u2019s all covered really well online for you.\nEmail is dead for people under 25 in my opinion. Young people don\u2019t use email. They use WhatsApp, SMS, SnapChat,\nFacebook; they don\u2019t use email. If you\u2019re targeting an older audience, email is still pretty successful. Email still works for\ndistribution, but realistically, email is not great for teenagers - even people at universities. You know how much you use\ninstant messaging apps, and how little you use emails. And you guys are probably on the high scale for email because\nyou\u2019re in Silicon Valley. That being said, on email the things to think about: Email, SMS, and Push Notifications all\nbehave the same way.

There\u2019s a lot of stuff\naround email where you have to look when you receive feedback from the servers you are sending emails to, 500 series\nerrors versus 400 series errors; you have to be respectful how those are handled. If someone gives you a hard bounce,\nretry once or twice and then stop trying because if you are someone who abuses people\u2019s inboxes, the email companies\nspam folder you, and it\u2019s very hard to get out. If you get caught in a spam house link, or anything like that, it\u2019s very hard to\nget out. It\u2019s really important with email that you are a high class citizen, and that you do good work with email because\nyou want to have deliverability for the long run.", "start_char_idx": 3483, "end_char_idx": 5207, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2355a215-e9f7-4ab5-b843-aa3cd191f00b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2355a215-e9f7-4ab5-b843-aa3cd191f00b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ef7a4fd-4498-4bd4-9be1-be7b2583cd29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "5e97ccfc8c5c14850c5484884c0bd5008f3f6e51be14a36906034bbb7f306421", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d24a4a8e-726d-45fb-b0e2-3dc605eec2f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "55b8bbbfc3bcae160f519c70eaa335f5544ac30417f0d20b52890cc70b7f9cce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cded9fe2-05e5-459f-a781-d1b48017b9bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b1770eb9a0f6faca68d14eb1c96b3ef5cabac842e2f17e325e46396f55125f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0479410c6d821390b6b49b201f6132428514ca57c8c1e7f6e89f5a3adeb5dfb4", "text": "That counts for push notifications and SMS, too. With SMS, you can go buy SMS traffic via grey routes with people who\nare having phones strung up attached to a computer and pumping out SMSs. That works for a time, but it always gets\nshut down. I\u2019ve seen so many companies make these mistakes where they think they\u2019re going to grow by using these\nkinds of tactics. If you can\u2019t get your email, SMS, or Push Notification delivered, you will never get any success from these.\nYou actually spam your power users and give them notifications they don\u2019t care about, making it really hard for them to\nopt out. Well, they start blocking you, and you can never push them once they\u2019ve opted out of your Push Notifications.\nAnd it\u2019s very hard to prompt them to turn them on once they\u2019ve turned them off.\nSo number one thing to think about regarding email, SMS, and Push Notifications is, you have to get them delivered.\nBeyond that, it\u2019s a question of open rate, click rate. So what is the compelling subject line you can put there so the people\ncan open your email, and how can you get them to click when they visit?\nEveryone focuses towards doing marketing emails that are just spam in my opinion. Newsletters are stupid. Don\u2019t do\nnewsletters because you\u2019ll send the same newsletter to everyone on your site. Someone who signed up to your site\nyesterday versus someone who\u2019s been using your product for three years - do they need the same message? No.\nThe most effective email you can do is notifications. So what are you sending? What should you be notifying people of?\nThis is a great place where we\u2019re in the wrong mindset. As a Facebook user, I don\u2019t want Facebook to email me about\nevery \u2018like\u2019 I receive, because I receive a lot of them since I have a lot of Facebook friends. But as a new Facebook user,\nthat first \u2018like\u2019 you receive is a magic moment. Turning on notifications throughout all of our channels, increased on our\nemails, SMS, and Push Notifications, but we only turned it on for low-engaged users who weren\u2019t coming back to the site,\nso it wouldn\u2019t be spamming for them.\nSo it was a great experience to think about that. The first thing you need to think about when sending emails, SMS, and\nPush Notifications is what notifications should we be sending. The second thing you need to be thinking about is how can\nyou create great triggered marketing campaigns. When someone created their first cross-border trade transaction was\none of the best email campaigns I was ever part of at eBay in terms of click through rate. It was awesome because it was\nreally timely, and really in context - the right thing to do for the user.\nI\u2019d say make sure you have deliverability. Focus on notifications and triggered based emails, SMS, and Push\nNotifications.\nThere\u2019s one thing I wanted to finish with, which is my favorite quote by General Patton. It\u2019s so cliche; it\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s\nawesome.\n\u201cA good plan, violently executed today, is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.\u201d\nAnd one other thing that Chamath instills in us and Mark still instills across the whole of Facebook is move fast and don\u2019t\nbe afraid to break stuff. If you can run more experiments than the next guy, if you can be hungry for growth, if you can fight\nand die for every extra user and you stay up late at night to get those extra users, to run those experiments, to get the\ndata, and do it over and over and over again, you will grow faster.\nMark has said he thinks we won because we wanted it more, and I really believe that. We just worked really hard. It\u2019s not\nlike we\u2019re crazy smart, or we\u2019ve all done these crazy things before. We just worked really really hard, and we executed\nfast.

I'll post a link to the slides on my Twitter account, and on that link, there will be a way for you to annotate\nthe slides. So you can ask me questions, and if we don't get to them, I'll answer them after the talk.\nSo you guys have been listening to a lot about growth over the last several weeks, and to me, I feel like growth is fairly\nsimple. It's the interaction between two concepts or variables: conversion rate and churn. The gap between those two\nthings pretty much indicates how fast you're going to grow. Most people, especially business-type people, tend to look at\nthis interaction in a very mathematical, calculated sort of way. Today I want to talk about these things at a more human\nscale because in a startup when you're interacting with your users, you have a fairly intimate interaction in the early\nstages, and so I think there's a different way of looking at this stuff in terms of how we build our products. We'll look at a lot\nof different examples of that and how it's executed well.\nMy philosophy behind a lot of things that I teach in startups is, the best way to get to $1 billion is to focus on the values\nthat help you get that first dollar to acquire that first user. If you get that right, everything else will take care of itself. It's a\nsort of faith thing.\nI came to be a partner at YC by a way of being an alumni. I went to the program of Winter 2006 (it was the second-ever\nprogram), and I built a product called Wufoo. Wufoo is an online form builder that helps you create contact forms, online\nsurveys, and simple payment forms. it's basically a database app that looks like it's designed by Fisher-Price. What's\ninteresting though is that because it was fairly easy to use, we had customers from every industry market and vertical you\ncan think of including a majority of the Fortune 500 companies.\nI ran the company for five years, and then we were acquired by Survey Monkey in 2011. At the time, we were a very\ninteresting acquisition. We were only a team of 10 people at the time, and while we acquired funding here in Silicon\nValley through Y Combinator, we actually ran the company from Florida. We had no office, everyone worked from home,\nand we were an interesting outlier. So each dot here represents a startup (PowerPoint slide) that exited through IPO or\nacquisition, we are the outlier to the left. The bottom represents the funding amount that they took, and vertical axis is the\nvaluation of the company at the time. To sum it up the average start up raises about $25 million, and the return for their\ninvestors is about 676%. Wufoo, raised about $118,000 total, and our return to our investors was about 29,561%.\nSo a lot of people are interested in what makes Wufoo a little bit different, or how do we run the company differently. And\na lot of it was focused on product. We weren't interested in building software that people just wanted to use, that reminded\nyou that you worked in a cubicle because it was a database app at its core. We wanted a product that people wanted to\nlove, that people wanted to have a relationship with, and we were actually very fanatical about how we approached this\nidea, to the point where it was almost sort of in a science-y way. So what we said was like, \"What's interesting about\nstartups in terms of us wanting to create things that people love, is that love and unconditional feelings, are difficult things\nfor us to do in real life. In startups, we have to do it at scale.\" So we decided to start off by asking, \u201cHow do relationships\nwork in the real world and how can we apply them to the way we run our business and build our product that way?\u201d\nWe'll go over these two metaphors: acquiring new users as if we are trying to date them, and existing users as if they are\na successful marriage.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4171, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23737720-fdb7-41f3-8488-c2807a86ef77": {"__data__": {"id_": "23737720-fdb7-41f3-8488-c2807a86ef77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7a7d3e2-faf9-4870-b0bb-925e628b8ef3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "579b82936bad987e36ea9b2d2bdb3bf7a8b853cf409a6b76dc74319e11585177", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cded9fe2-05e5-459f-a781-d1b48017b9bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2b1770eb9a0f6faca68d14eb1c96b3ef5cabac842e2f17e325e46396f55125f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ecac55d-e914-4287-832e-389bb91270da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "baa666d7552eab064dc1f2dae680b7a0ed97075d6e24f3dd8647aab8cfe75ac0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "49c5c74c994d7ddfb2b4466f830e46c8a22ca6d7f33b7652b5dbff1557c026c0", "text": "We wanted a product that people wanted to\nlove, that people wanted to have a relationship with, and we were actually very fanatical about how we approached this\nidea, to the point where it was almost sort of in a science-y way.

Human beings are relationship-manufacturing creatures. We cannot help but create,\nand anthropomorphize, the things we interact with over and over again. Whether it's the cars we drive, or the clothes we\nwear, or the tools and softwares we use, we eventually prescribe characteristics to it, a personality, and we expected it to\nbehave a certain way - that's how we sort of interact with it.\nFirst impressions are important for the start of any relationship because it's the one we tell over and over again, right?\nThere\u2019s something special about how we regard that origin story. Let me give you an example. If you're on the first date\nwith somebody, and you\u2019re having a nice dinner, but you catch them picking their nose, you are probably not going to\nhave another date with them. But if you're married to someone for about 20 to 30 years, and you catch them on the\nBarcaLounger digging for gold, you don't immediately call your lawyer, you know what I mean, and say, \"We have a\nproblem here, you have to start drawing up papers for divorce.\" You shrug your shoulders, and say, \"At least he has a\nheart of gold.\"\nSo something about first-time interactions means that the threshold was so much lower in terms of pass fail. So in\nsoftware and for most products in Internet software that we use, first impressions are pretty obvious and there are things\nyou see a lot of companies pay attention to in terms of what they send their marketing people to work on. My argument for\npeople who are very good at product is that they discover so many other moments and make them memorable: the first\nemail you ever get, what happens when you got your first login, the links, the advertisements, the very first time you\ninteracted with customer support. All of those are opportunities to seduce.\nSo how do we think about making first moments? We actually took this concept from the Japanese. They actually have\ntwo words for how to describe things when you're finished with them, in terms of saying, \"is this a quality item?\" The two\nwords for quality are atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu. The first one means taken for granted quality, which\nbasically means functionality. The last one means enchanting quality. Take for example a pen. Something has\nmiryokuteki if the weight of the pen, the way the ink flows out of it, the way it's viewed by the people reading the hand\nwriting from the pen, is pleasurable both to the user of the pen and the people who experience the byproducts, taking it to\nthe next level. Let's start with some examples.\nThis is Wufoo's login link, and it has a dinosaur on it, which I think is awesome! But if you hover it, the spec has the added\nbenefit of having a tool tip that doesn't tell you how to log in or what it does, but basically \"RARRR!\" What we noticed\nabout this in early usability stages, is that this put a smile on people\u2019s faces, like hands down, universally. I think a lot of\ntimes when we are assessing products we never think about, \"Hey, what is the emotion on the person's face when they\ninteract with this?\"\nThis is Vimeo's launching page; this is actually a couple iterations ago, it's the one that I find to be the most beautiful.

So at our company, one weird value we have is that our cofounders are\nbig medieval nuts, and we would take everyone out to Medieval Times every single year on the anniversary and founding\nof the company. So we said we have to do something in that flavor. We contacted the guys at armor.com, and said, \"Can\nyou forge us a custom battle axe?\" We said, if you win our programming contest, you would win one. The result is, people\nwanted to talk about this. People wanted to say they were working on this because they wanted to say, \"I am\nprogramming for a weapon.\" What's cool is we had over 25 different applications created for us, of quality and quantity\nthat we could not have paid for on the budget and time that we had.

There's a broken feedback\nloop there. People are divorced from the consequences of their actions. This is a result from the natural evolution of how\nmost companies get founded, especially by technical cofounders. Before launch, it is a time of bliss, Nirvana, and\nopportunity. Nothing that you do is wrong. By your hand, which you feel is like God, every line you write and every code\nyou write feels perfect; it's genius to you. The thing that happens is after launch, reality sets in, and all these other tasks\ncome in to play; things that we have to deal with. Now what technical cofounders want to do is get back to that initial state,\nso what we often see is the company starts siloing off these other things that makes a startup company real, and have\nother people do them. In our minds these other tasks are inferior, and we have other people in the company do them.\nSo for us, what we're trying to figure out is how we change software development so that we inject some values that we\ndon't talk about enough, like responsibility, accountability, humility, and modesty. We call this SDD (Support Driven\nDevelopment). It's a way of creating high-quality software, but it's super simple; you don't need a bunch of Post-it notes.\nAll you have to do is make everyone do customer support. What you end up having is you fix the feedback. The people\nwho built the software are the ones supporting it, and you get all these nice benefits as a result.\nOne of them is support responsible developers and designers. When people built the stuff, they give the very best\nsupport. Now we are not the first people to think of this. Paul English was a big supporter of this in Kayak. What he did\nwas install a red customer support phone line in the middle of the engineering floor, and it would just ring with customer\nsupport calls. People would often ask him \"Why would you pay engineers $120,000 or more to do something that you can\npay other people a fraction of.\" He said, \"Well, after the second or third time that the phone rings, and the engineer get the\nsame problem, they stop what they're doing, they fix the bug, and they stop getting phone calls about it.\" It's a way of\nhaving QA in a sort of nice, elegant solution.\nNow, John Gottman talks about the reason that we often break up with one another is due to four major causes. They are\nwarning signs. He calls them the Four Horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling. Criticism is basically\npeople starting to focus, not just on the specific issue at hand, but on the over arching issues like \"You never listen to\nusers\" or \"You never think about us\" all the time. Contempt is when somebody is purposely trying to insult another\nperson. Defensiveness is not trying to take accountability, or trying to make excuses for their actions. Stonewalling is\nbasically shutting down. Stonewalling according to John Gottman, is one of the worst things we can do in a relationship.\nOften times we don't worry about these things in customer support, criticism or contempt. Defensiveness, you see this all\nthe time especially in companies as they get older. But stonewalling, this is something I see happening with startups all\nthe time. You get a bunch of customer support calls coming in, and you just think, \"I don't need to answer, I don't need to\nrespond.\" That act of not even getting back to them is one of the worst things you can do, and it's probably some of the\nbiggest causes of churn in the early stages of startups.\nThis is how support worked out with Wufoo. When we were acquired we had about 500,000 users on the system, 5\nmillion people used Wufoo forms and reports whether they knew it or not, and all those people got support from the same\n10 people, and usually there was one person dedicated to support a day, for any shift.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4198, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52b8c940-6a80-46d9-8ce7-e103194cb19d": {"__data__": {"id_": "52b8c940-6a80-46d9-8ce7-e103194cb19d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b608888f-d17e-425e-b4d9-d022e4fa9dfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "87ccdc6b00ff3eea3b0ec3a6fb40f35fda773fedb594d647a0d3260f0cac3fb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0aee9c0b-25e7-490e-9850-cbde69c63f3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "54179600b394f1b9a801ca35ff4e0cf2a60eb712ad2d906dd02d4446581ee262", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f93b60a7-4cd5-4fb7-957b-b74064422436", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "595c05f9b19ddb2457f51545061034f59965cb9ec1b813429bcfc57ee81c4f27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9e5914511512164583828e9c19366612e4f12c31a21b703b04b469aca341dece", "text": "Defensiveness, you see this all\nthe time especially in companies as they get older.

One experiment\nwe did was, we heard someone here do a talk about how there's a disconnect between the emotions that we have when\nwe need help, and the content and the reaction we get from people when we get help to people, especially online,\nbecause they just don't see those nonverbal cues. So she said, unless there's face recognition on the web, we are just\nalways going to be disconnected from our users. Our feeling was like, \"We're not face recognition experts, but we think\nthere's another way of getting empathy.\" So, as form builders we added a drop-down, and what we said was, \"what's your\nemotional state.\" Our hypothesis was nobody's going to fill this out; we thought this was going to be a lame experiment,\nbut we'll see how it goes. It turned out that this field was filled out 75.8% of the time. The Browser Type drop-down field in\ncomparison was filled out 78.1% of the time. So people were basically telling us, \"For my technical support issue, how I\nfeel about this problem is just as important as all the technical details you need to figure out in order to debug it.\"\nWe didn't prioritize things or triage things by emotion, so for the most part people didn't game the system. One of the\ninteresting byproducts of it was that we noticed that people started being nicer to us. We went back and looked at the\ndata, did some text analysis and realized when it comes to communicating with people over written words like email,\nthere's only three ways in which you show strong emotions: exclamation marks, curse words, AND ALL CAPS. Sure\nenough, on all three of those metrics, they've gone down in the way people were talking to us in customer support. Once\npeople had a simple outlet for their emotions, it made them a lot more rational, and a made our jobs much more pleasant\nas a result.\nThe other byproduct that is awesome is that you actually build better software when you do this \u2013 far better software. This\nis actually backed up by a whole bunch of research. Jared Spool, at User Interface Engineer (one of the biggest players\nin the space) says that there's a direct correlation to how much time we spend directly exposed to users and how good\nour designs get. He said it has to come in this specific way. It has to be a direct exposure. It can't be something where\nsomeone generates a report or through a graph. You have to be interacting with them in somewhat real time. It has to be\na minimum of every six weeks, and it has to be for at least two hours; otherwise your software will get worse over time.\nOur developers, the people who are with Wufoo, are getting exposed to our users 4 to 8 hours every single week. What it\ndoes is that it changes the way you sort of build software.\nJared Spool has another way of talking about how we build products. Imagine that this represents all the knowledge\nneeded to use your app on a spectrum (PowerPoint slide). This is like no knowledge (far-left) and this is all the\nknowledge needed (far-right). These two lines are pretty much your interaction with users. This is currently where their\nknowledge point is (PowerPoint slide), and this is the target point where you're trying to get them to. The gap between the\ntwo is called the knowledge gap as Spool calls it. And what's interesting about this is there's only two ways to fix this. That\ngap represents how intuitive your app is. You either get the user to increase their knowledge or decrease the amount of\nknowledge that's needed to use the application. And often times as engineers or people who build and work on these\nproducts we think let's add new features. New features only means let's increase the knowledge gap.\nSo for us we actually focused on the other direction.

New features only means let's increase the knowledge gap.\nSo for us we actually focused on the other direction.

This is Wufoo's growth curve for the first five years (PowerPoint slide).\nWhat's interesting is that we paid no money on advertising or marketing; all of it was done by word-of-mouth growth. The\ninteraction between new users and downgrades are this (PowerPoint slide). It's so slight what it takes, that gap, making\nthat work. What a lot of people keep forgetting is that there's almost no difference between an increase in conversion rate,\n1% increase, and 1% decrease in churn; they do the exact same thing to your growth.; however, the latter is actually\nmuch easier to do, and much cheaper to do.

This is the\none I'm proud of because even though we had this nice, awesome curve of growth, this is what allowed us to scale, keep\nthe company small, and have an awesome culture. And that required doing a lot of these things to help people do what\nthey need.\nSo John Gottman noticed that there was a different type of behavior for relationships, and why people divorced. Basically\nthere were these subsets of people who stayed together 10 to 15 years and all of a sudden divorced. None of the other\nindicators would show that this was going to happen. He was looking through the data and realized, \"Oh there's no\npassion, there's no fire between these people.\" When it comes to relationships, they kind of follow the second law of\nthermodynamics: In an enclosed energy system, things tend to run down, so you constantly have to be putting energy\nand effort back into it. The way a lot of people think showing people that \"I care about you\" in products and companies is\nby doing things like creating a blog or making a newsletter. The thing is we look at these rates and basically it was such a\nsmall percentage of our active users, most of them had no idea about the awesome things that we were doing for them.\nSo we built a new tool and called it the Wufoo Alert System. It allowed us to timestamp every new feature that we are\nbuilding for users, and that every time they would login we would look at the difference between their log in time, or last\nlogin in time, and the new features that were implemented, and they would have this message show up, \"Hey since\nyou've been gone, here's all the awesome stuff that Wufoo did for you.\" Hands-down, this was the most talked about\nfeature that I heard every time I went out to talk to users. They would say things like, \"Dude I love that 'Since you've been\ngone' thing. Even though I pay the same amount every single month, you guys are doing something for me almost every\nweek. It's totally awesome; it makes me feel like I'm getting maximum value.\"\nThe other thing that we did in addition to having everyone support the people that paid their paycheck, is have them say\n\"thank you.\" And this was in large part due to us injecting humility and modesty into the equation. Every single Friday we\nwould get together, we would write simple handwritten thank you cards to our users. And I know there are tons of people\nwho would not be sort of excited about doing this; it was a ritual that made all the difference in terms of like having a team\nthat was very tightly knit, and working on stuff that they really cared about. They constantly knew what the mission was for,\nand why we sort of did what we did. These aren't fancy thank you cards; they're just simple handwritten stuff on index\ncards, we threw in a sticker, and slapped on a dinosaur on the front of it.\nWhat's interesting is we started this practice as a result of the early days of starting Wufoo. Chris, Ryan, and I were talking\nto try to figure out what we were going to do to show users that we appreciated them around Christmas, and Chris came\nup with this idea where he said, \"Hey guys, a couple years ago my mom made me write thank you letters to all my\nrelatives for my Christmas presents, and I really didn't like to do it, but the following year all my presents were super\ngood... so I think we should try this for our business and see how it goes.\"\nSo that first year we wrote handwritten Christmas cards to all of our users that first year. Second year rolls around, and we\nhave too many customers with just the three founders. We were thinking, \"We're kind of screwed; we don't know what\nwe're going to do.\" Well, we read a book called The Ultimate Question and in it, he talks about focusing on your most\nprofitable users; if you just take care of them, things will work out. So we thought, \"That will work out, that's scalable.\"\nBasically we only wrote to our highest-paying customers.

There's an article that was put out by the Harvard Business Review several years ago\nby Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema and in it they talk about the discipline of market leaders. They say there's only\nthree ways that you achieve market dominance, and depending on how you want to achieve that market dominance, you\nhave to organize your company in a very specific way: best price, best product, and best overall solution. For best price,\nyou focus on logistics, so Wal-Mart and Amazon. If you want to be the best product out there, you focus on R&D, Apple is\nusually a quintessential example of that. Best overall solution is about being customer intimate.

What I love about this path towards market dominance is\nthat the third one is the only one that everyone can do at any stage of their company. It requires almost no money to get\nstarted with it. It usually just requires a little bit of humility and some manners. And as a result, you can achieve the\nsuccess of any other people in of your market. That's all I got, thank you very much.\nQ: So what do you do when you have a product with many different types of users? How do you build one product that all\nthese users love?\nA: There is an interesting fine line for that. What I usually tell people is focus on those who are the most passionate,\nespecially in the early stages. Whatever niche it's going to be in, that's where I'm going to focus on completely. I think Ben\nSilverman from Pinterest started off with design bloggers. Tailor your thing for them, and eventually you'll figure out\nuniversal values that will appeal to a lot of other people. So just start one at a time. And a lot of examples that you see up\nthere, a lot of companies make the mistake of just thinking \"Oh I'll just make my app funny.\" Humor is like really difficult to\ndo. When you want to shoot for something witty, you have to get functionality right. So like the Japanese quality. If you\ndon't have atarimae, don't try to do anything witty, because it'll backfire. So hands down our number one focus in Wufoo\nwas to make everything as easy to use as possible; everything else was just polish.\nQ: How do we balance being obsessed with working on product with all the other skills that are needed by a company,\nsuch as marketing, branding, etc?\nA: If you're working on product, you should also always have this flip-side where you're talking to users. For us inside of\nWufoo, the way we got people to talk to users was through customer support. They got to see firsthand whether the\nfeatures worked or not, and it also impacted everyone else in the company because everyone had a customer support\nshift, so they had a social incentive to make everything work. There should be no point where you are only focused on\nproduct. You should always have time where you work on product, and then you see what users say to you - like ongoing\nvirtual feedback. So be careful when you don't have that.\nMy feeling on marketing and sales, my feeling is marketing and sales is a tax you pay because you haven't made your\nproduct remarkable. Word-of-mouth is the easiest kind of growth, and it\u2019s how a lot of the great companies grow. Figure\nout how to have a story that people want to tell about your product where they are the most interesting one at the dinner\ntable. And then that person is your sales person. That person is your sales force for you.\nQ: How do you make a decision on product and communicate that with your engineering team when there are lots of\ndifferent directions to go?\nA: We just looked at customer support, which is really easy because you see what people are having the most amount of\ntrouble with. You cannot help but get feature requests from people. No matter whatever openings you have in your\nproduct or app, people will jam feature requests in there, so you're going to know what they want. Your job as a product\nperson and an engineer is to not just do what they say, because that way you'll just be a slave. You have to figure out and\nsolve what they really want, that deep underlying reason. The thing is if everyone wants to have a different way to go,\nthen ultimately someone's going to figure something out. But also, make the smallest version of each little idea, no longer\nthan 1 to 2 weeks to build it, so you can try it out to see what works and what doesn't. It's dangerous to have multiple\nproduct directions that require a lot of time to figure out.\nQ: Can you relay the story about how the King for a Day thing was good at Wufoo?\nA: Yeah, okay so I don't like hackathons. I think they sort of suck in terms of those done inside of companies because you\nspend like 48 hours working really hard on something that you're really passionate about, and 99% of them never make it\nout to production.

The king got to tell everyone else\nwhat to do on product. So everything that was bothering them about Wufoo or any other feature that they wanted to have\nbuilt, they got engineering, marketing, and advertising resources of everyone in the company to make it happen.

And that's a good way to democratize it a little bit, by rotating it around.\nQ: You said you guys all work from home, which usually seems like a nightmare. How did you make that work?\nA: We all work from home, and we all work around the Tampa Bay area. We would allow anyone to work from anywhere\nbut usually as we tried to recruit them and meet our team, they usually decided to come and move here anyway. Remote\nworking is especially tricky. A lot of people like to romanticize it, especially people who are employees, but the thing is an\noffice gives you a lot of benefits and efficiencies that you now have to compensate for when you have remote working.\nBut remote working also has these sort of efficiencies. For example, I don't have to worry about my employees losing two\nhours of their day to commuting. So the biggest thing we had to do for remote working is to respect people's time. The\nway we had it set up is we actually had a 4 1/2 day workweek at Wufoo; half-day on Friday was for all the meetings and\nstuff. We said, no biz dev meetings, no talking with other outside parties. They'd have to be done on Friday, on that half-\nday; they couldn't be done in the middle of the week. And then also one day of everyone was already dedicated to\ncustomer support. So everyone in our company effectively only had three days each week to actually build and work on\nwhatever they were doing. But I actually firmly believe that if you have three solid days, 8 to 10 hours, when you're only\nworking on what you need to build, you can get a ton of shit done. So, what we said was, you have to respect everyone's\ntime during that three day period.\nWhat we came up with was a 15 minute rule. You could have a chat or a phone call with someone, but it could last no\nlonger than 15 minutes. So if you had some complicated issue that you couldn't figure out, at 15 minutes you are to\nimmediately table that item, and have us discuss it on Friday. You'd move on to the next item on your list. I would say 90%\nof the time, the item never got brought up on Friday, because usually what would happen is people would sleep on it, and\nthen you would magically say \"Hey I found a solution!\" Or \"Hey that's not a big problem whatsoever.\" Most problems\ninside a company don't need to be solved in real time or right away. The only things are like when the site is down or\nwhen payments aren't working. Everything outside of that is kind of luxury. So focus on your priorities as much as\npossible, and as a result our 10 person team did far more than many many other companies.\nBut it takes extra work to make remote working happen. We are an extremely disciplined team, and I would have to say,\nthere are not many YC companies that have been able to replicate what we do. I think there are only two companies in\nYC that have been able to replicate our discipline style. It takes more work in a very different fashion. And often allows\nyou to be a little bit lazier, in terms of all these things around productivity.\nQ: How do we set up accountability for our employees as a manager?\nA: We were profitable nine months after launch, so we had profit-sharing, which makes incentives pretty simple and clear.\nIt would be a multiple of whatever sort of bonus pool that we had, and performance measures would be based on how\nthey did in customer support, on their duties there, and what they said they wanted to accomplish. I don't like process and\nI don't like a lot of tools to help people to be productive, so the only thing that we had to help people manage their\nprojects is a To-do list.

They set the tone for how they want to be\nassessed. And for people who are excellent at what they do, it works very very well. And when you actually have\nproblems, it's very easy to fire people. I was fortunate enough not to have to fire anyone at Wufoo, but we were able to\ncorrect everyone's behavior very very quickly because we just looked at this and evaluated the problem: \"Look this is a\npattern of behavior.

So you contract them out, and have them work remotely as\nsuch. Usually the projects I like to have them work on are about one month long so you can get a good sense of how\npeople manage themselves and work on things. That was always the first assessment; we never did things just by\ninterviews.\nThe other thing we had to screen them for was their ability to do customer support because not every engineer has those\nempathy skills to handle that stress. So sometimes I would have people write \"break-up\" letters to me in an interview,\ngiving them 15 minutes to write it. That way you get a good sense of their writing skills because 90% of what you're doing\nin customer support is telling customers bad news like \"we don't support that feature, sorry,\" or \"no that's not going to\nwork,\" or \"that's not going to be available.\"\nQ: Are there any tricks or experiments that didn't work out in your company?\nA: Okay I'll talk about one. So one of the things that we did early on to try to motivate ourselves was - like, we understood\nthe idea of crunch mode, and that it's really bad for people. Like if you're doing the subscription business, you need\npeople to last for the long-term, and in video games, a lot of the time they crunch people for a specific time and they have\nmultiple sprints. Most of the time the deadlines can get super exhausting. You might get an increase in productivity, but\nthe recovery that you need for people is always greater than the productivity you gain. And in a company where you need\neveryone doing customer support, being on their game, and constantly pushing out features, you don't have time for\nrecovery.\nSo we were thinking that we wanted to build a company vacation into how Wufoo works to reward our users every single\nyear. So we thought, if the vacation is built in for the recovery, we can have one crunch period before the vacation set up\nand only do customer support that will sort of scale with people. So the way we did the very first crunch mode was that, it\nwas just between the three founders, and we had each of us draw a 10 item To-do list that would be fairly aggressive.\nThe first person to get through seven of their items would win, and the last person to get through seven of their items,\nwould become what we called \"Trip Bitch.\" Trip Bitch meant that you carried the other person's luggage and got people\ndrinks when you're on the company vacation. So we did that, and during that period, everyone was pretty excited about it.\nThe winner also got to choose the next company vacation. But all of a sudden, Ryan had basically poorly estimated the\nitems on his list and realized very quickly, \"I'm going to fucking lose,\" and he just sort of gave up. So crunch mode, turned\nout to be blah mode for him because he knew he was going to lose and became pretty demoralized. So as a result of that\nwe decided not to do it in that similar fashion anymore. Good idea that we like to talk about, but it was one that we never\ndid again.\nAlright guys, thanks a lot!

I'm Stanley, the founder of DoorDash. It's really amazing to be here, because it wasn't actually that\nlong ago when I sat in your seats. I was class of 2014, graduated in CS, as well as my cofounder Andy. For those of you\nwho don't know what DoorDash is, we're building an on-demand delivery network for local cities. I want to start off with\nthis photo that I took a few months ago. This was the night when we just raised our series A. I took this photo as I was\nwalking back to where I lived; I actually lived in Roble at the time on campus. I took this photo because I realized just how\nridiculous the combination of things I was holding in my hand was at the time. I was holding my CS247 homework, my tax\nforms (it was April \u2013 so I had to fill out my tax forms), that yellow speeding ticket, and right below that was a $15 million\npiece of paper I had just signed from Sequoia. And that kind of summarizes just how ridiculous our journey has been,\ndoing this while I was at Stanford, and then transitioning this to an actual startup. I want to share with you that story today.\nIt all began two years ago in a macaroon store. It was my junior year at Stanford during the fall quarter. At the time, I was\nreally passionate about building technology for small business owners. I sat down with Chloe, the owner of Chantal\nGuillon, a macaroon store in Palo Alto at the time, just interviewing her, trying to get feedback on this prototype we'd been\nworking on, and also just learning about what her problems were in general. It was during this meeting when Chloe first\nbrought up this problem of delivery. I remember she brought down this really really thick booklet. She showed me pages\nand pages of delivery orders, and a lot of these orders she had to turn down because there was no way she could have\nfulfilled them. She had no drivers, and she ended up having to personally deliver all these orders. That was a very\ninteresting moment for us.\nOver the course of the next few weeks, we talked to around 150 to 200 small business owners, and when we brought up\nthis idea of delivery, they kept agreeing with us; they would say, \"You know, we don't have delivery infrastructure. It's such\na huge pain for us. There aren't any good solutions out there.\" This led us to wonder, delivery is such a common thing,\nsuch an obvious thing; why hasn't anyone solved this yet? Like, we must be missing something here right? We thought it\nwas maybe because people had already tried this in the past, but they failed because there wasn't consumer demand for\nthis. We asked ourselves, \"How can we test this hypothesis?\" We were just a bunch of college kids at the time. We didn't\nown trucks or delivery infrastructure or anything like that; we couldn't just build a delivery company overnight right? So\nhow could we test this assumption we had?\nWe decided to create a simple experiment with restaurant delivery. We spent about an afternoon just putting together a\nquick landing page. When I went on the Internet, I found some PDF menus of restaurants in Palo Alto. We stuck it up there\nand added a phone number at the bottom, which was actually our personal cell phone number. And that was it. We put\nup the landing page and called it PaloAltoDelivery.com. This is actually what it looked liked (PowerPoint slide): It was\nsuper simple, ugly, and honestly we weren't really expecting anything - we just launched it. What we wanted to see was\njust would we receive phone calls, and if we got enough phone calls, then maybe this delivery idea was worth pursuing.\nSo we put it up there; we weren't really expecting anything, and all of a sudden we got a phone call. Someone called!\nThey wanted to order Thai food. And we're like, \u201cThis is a real order; we're going to have to do something about it.\u201d So\nwe're in our cars and we're like, \"We're not doing anything right now, might as well swing by, pick up some Pad Thai, and\nlet's try to see how this whole delivery thing works.\" And we did.

You had to look up PDF menus to place your orders and then call in.\nThis isn't exactly the most professional-looking site, yet we kept getting phone calls; we kept getting orders. And that's\nkind of when we knew that we were onto something. We knew we found a need people wanted when people were willing\nto put up with all of this.\nI think another key point to remember is we launched this in about an hour. We didn't have any drivers; we didn't have\nany algorithms; we didn't have a backend; we didn't spend six months building a fancy dispatch system \u2013 we didn't have\nany of that. We just launched because at the beginning it's all about testing the idea, trying to get this thing off the ground,\nand figuring out if this was something people even wanted. And it's okay to hack things together at the beginning.\nAt YC there's a mantra we like to talk about that is doing things that don't scale. So at the beginning we were the delivery\ndrivers. We would go to class, and then after we would go deliver food. We were the customer support; you know I\nsometimes had to take phone calls during lectures. We spent afternoons just going down University Avenue just passing\nout flyers trying to promote DoorDash. We didn't have any dispatch system so what we had to do was use Square to\ncharge all of our customers. We used a Google Doc to keep track of our orders. We used Apple's Find My Friends to keep\ntrack of where all of our drivers were. You know, just stuff like that, just hacking together solutions to try to get this thing off\nthe ground. In fact at one point we were growing so fast that Square actually shut us down because we were under\nsuspicion for money laundering. I mean think about it, we were getting small chunks of $15-$20 orders coming in at a\nrapid pace. Luckily, my cofounder Tony worked at Square so he just emailed some buddies there and everything was\nsolved.\nAnother thing about doing things that don't scale is it also allows you to become an expert in your business, like driving\nhelped us understand how the whole delivery process worked. We used that as an opportunity to talk to our customers,\ntalk to restaurants. We did dispatching which helped us figure out - you know, we manually dispatched our drivers and\nthat helped us figure out what our driver assignment algorithms should look like. We did customer support ourselves,\ngetting real-time feedback from customers. I remember for the first few months when we got started, we would manually\nemail every single new customer at the end of every night asking how their first delivery went, and how they heard about\nus. We would personalize all these emails: If I saw someone order chicken skewers from Oren's Hummus, we would say\n\"Oh I love Oren's Hummus. How are your chicken skewers? How did you hear about us?\" Feedback like that was really\nvaluable, and customers really appreciated that.\nI remember this one time - this was during YC - we had just come out of a meeting with one of our restaurant partners,\nand we heard about this ice cream place that had just opened up on University Avenue called Cream, and we wanted to\ngo try it out. Then all of a sudden, our cofounder back at our office/house texted us saying \"Oh we need drivers on the\nroad; we got a huge spike in demand.\" So we debated for maybe about 10 seconds if we should go get ice cream or\nshould we go deliver. We obviously went to deliver, but that kind of became our motivation on scaling, like you know, if\nwe would scale, then we could go get ice cream next time.\nNow of course we scale across different cities. Now we have to worry about building automated solutions, building\ndispatch systems, and figuring out how to match demand and supply - all that fancy technology stuff. But none of that\nmattered at the beginning because at the beginning it's all about getting the thing off the ground, and trying to find\nproduct-market fit.\nJust to summarize, there are three things I would say I learned from doing DoorDash. First, test your hypothesis. You want\nto treat your startup ideas like experiments. The second thing is, launch fast. We launched in less than an hour with a\nreally simple landing page.

And then after that, we did barely any marketing. I think I sent out\none email to my dorm, and that was about it. It was all through word-of-mouth.

What's your answer now looking back?\nA: Looking back I think the biggest thing is mobile. Now everyone has one of those in their pocket, and we saw that trend\nand thought what if you could design a delivery system that was entirely based off mobile, where you didn't have to have\nany infrastructure, or delivery fleets. Instead of hiring drivers full-time or purchasing vehicles, what if you could tap into\nmore of an on-demand pool of independent contractors, and only send orders to them when they have time. So that's\nkind of the insight we had; everything was done through mobile.\nQ: Did you know you were going to be a startup, or were you just making some money at first?\nA: At the time we were all just really passionate about building technology for small business owners, and obviously this\ndelivery thing came out of an experiment with the landing page. It was literally an experiment. We weren't expecting\nanything, and it just took off, and we just went with it. And logistics was always something we were really passionate\nabout as well, like logistics of transportation \u2013 the perfect fusion of how you can help small business owners through\ndelivery.\nQ: Did you launch the mobile site first or the website?\nA: We started with this landing page right here which took us about an hour to launch.\nQ: How does DoorDash stand out amongst a very competitive space?\nA: At the beginning consumer demand was never a problem, even up until now. So for us it's just about finding a need\nand just focusing on serving that demand. At the beginning competition doesn't really matter.\nQ: How long did it take you to get incorporated into a company?\nA: We launched in January 2013, and then we did YC that very summer. When we decided to take this idea through YC,\nwe incorporated.\nQ: Where do you plan to go beyond food delivery?\nA: For us when we started DoorDash, it was always about helping small business owners and figuring out how you\nserved this for any local merchant whether you were a macaroon store, restaurant, or furniture shop. That's still our focus;\nthat's our long-term vision. For now we are just focused on restaurant delivery as a way to scale, but ultimately that's\nwhere we want to end up in.\nSam Altman: Next is Walker Williams, founder of Teespring.

I want to talk to you about one of the most fundamental advantages you have as a start up, and that's\nthat you are able to do things that don't scale.\nI define things that don't scale as things that are sort of fundamentally unsustainable; they will not last; they will not bring\nin the millionth user. Where they break, it's usually time but it could be a number of other things. But it's really growth\nstrategies that won't take you to a million users.

You\nknow, everybody, and this includes me when we got started, looks for that dream solution, that paperclip campaign that\nhas tremendous ROI, some accelerating partnership that's going to springboard you into the stratosphere, and affiliate\nagreement; something that solves it for you. But the reality is for the vast majority of companies and in fact for every\ncompany that I've had the chance to speak to the CEO of, that's just not possible - those are unicorns. And most of the\ncompanies that from the outside look like they've had this dream growth curve, the reality is that those first users were\nimpossibly hard to get. Let me tell you about the story about this ridiculously unsustainable business.\nSo this is Teespring in 2012 (PowerPoint). When we first launched, the business couldn't have looked worse. It took days\nof meetings; we had to offer free designs, and days of revisions back-and-forth, we'd have to launch the product\nourselves, we'd have to do the social media, all to sell about 50 shirts to a local nonprofit and generate about $1000 of\nrevenue. Anybody looking in would've said, \"You guys have to give up, this is a terrible idea.\" But as time went on, those\nusers started to add up, and I think something you have to understand is when you first launch a company, just by virtue\nof the fact that it's a new product, you're going to be bad at selling it right? You've got no idea what the pain points of\ncustomers really are. You've never sold that before. You don't have any success stories to point to, or testimonials. Those\nfirst users are always going to be the hardest.\nAnd so it's your responsibility as a founder to do whatever it takes to bring in your first users. It's going to be different for\nevery company. The common thread that I hear is, founders need to spend personal time and effort, a lot of their personal\ntime and effort to bring those users in themselves. It could mean a number of things - anything from sending 100 emails a\nday, getting on the phone and just calling as many people as you can, going through a network like Stanford or Y\nCombinator. Anything you can do to just get that first user. I really equate it to pushing a boulder uphill. And if you think of\na smooth hill when you get started, the incline is the steepest and those first inches are the hardest. But over time as you\nget farther and farther, the incline steadies out, it gets easier, and eventually you reach a point where you're at the top of\nthe hill and the boulder starts to roll on its own.\nAnd so for those first users, you cannot just focus on ROI in the sense of time. Do not expect to spend an hour and return\nthousands of dollars. Maybe Stanley was one of those unicorns - really incredible story. But for most of us, those first two\nusers are going to take a lot of handholding, a lot of personal love, and that's okay - that's essential for building a\ncompany. The one caveat of that is, I don't recommend giving your product for free. And there are plenty of exceptions to\nthis rule, but in general, cutting costs or giving the product away is an unsustainable strategy I wouldn't recommend. You\nneed to make sure that users value your product. And you know, people treat products that are free in a much different\nway than a paid product, and often times it can give you a false sense of security like, \"Oh we're getting all these users;\nsurely we can convert them to paid.\"\nThe second aspect is what happens when you get those users? How do you turn those users into champions? A\nchampion is a user who talks about and advocates for your product. Every company with a great growth strategy has\nusers who are champions. The easiest way to turn a user into a champion is to the delight them with an experience they\nare going to remember, so something that's unusual or out of the ordinary \u2013 an exceptional experience.\nThe easiest way to do this early, and again something that is completely unsustainable - it's not going to scale forever - is\nto just talk to those users.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f05a38ab-a84d-4020-ac07-17735dea1546": {"__data__": {"id_": "f05a38ab-a84d-4020-ac07-17735dea1546", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1420f00-5529-4788-9aea-ce017e90d494", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "fc39bcb1508a15f51bf42dd319639a902099879b8e5b7985d1d98afa8ee5ed17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3003da95-7c34-41f9-ae5b-c05b4db1f602", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "b4e42d2ff7fbcdfafc872e778f56eab160c6b43a5b72a316f39a4b8aa469f503", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fdd811b5-0302-4a61-95c1-292c059942d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a602d91180859997eb53166535af0ae39ffda1b115760acb8da5e36f8f0b014e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0295e144a90ac1fd8e3d36fce66d8785305476b49a924120a2b0c9f4dc47226c", "text": "You\nneed to make sure that users value your product.

People will say this all the time, it's sort of the core tenant of Y Combinator, is talk to users. I\ncannot stress how important it is that you spend a large chunk of your time talking to users. You should do it constantly,\nevery single day, and as long as possible. Today at Teespring, I'm still the catchall email address, so anytime anybody\nmisspells \"support\" or writes an email address that doesn't exist, I get that email. And so I still do about 10 to 20 customer\nservice tickets every single day; I spend hours each night reading every single tweet, probably a little bit OCD, but that's\nokay; I read through all the Teespring communities. You're never going to get a better sense for your products than\nactually listening to real users. Especially in the early days, the product and the feature set you launch with is almost\ncertainly not going to be the feature set that you scale with. So the quicker you talk to users and learn what they actually\nneed, the faster you can get to that point.\nThere are three ways to talk to your customers. You can run customer service yourself. Up until Teespring was doing\nabout $130-$140,000 a month, my cofounder Evan and I did everything in customer service.

But it's so important that you go through that and learn what you need to build, and what\nyou need to fix.\nThe second step is to proactively reach out to current and churn customers. Churn customers are customers who have\nleft. This is one that often falls by the wayside in the pursuit of new customers, but you want to make sure that your\ncustomers are having consistent good experiences; you don't want to take your current users for granted. When a user\nactually leaves your service, you want to reach out and find out why, both because that personal outreach can make the\ndifference between leaving and staying; sometimes people just need to know that you care and it's going to get better.\nAnd even if you can't bring them back, there's a chance that you can learn from the mistakes you made that caused them\nleave, and fix it so you don't churn users out in the future in the same way.\nFinally, the one I'm probably most OCD about is social media and communities. You need to know how people are\ntalking about your brand. You need to try to make sure that when somebody does have a bad experience, and they're\ntalking about it, that you make it right. Problems are inevitable: You're not going to have the perfect product; things are\ngoing to break; things are going to go wrong. That's not important. What's important is to always make it right, to always\ngo the extra mile and make that customer happy. One detractor who's had a terrible experience in your platform is\nenough to reverse the progress of 10 champions. That's all it takes, is one to say, \"No you shouldn't use those guys for X\nreasons,\" to ruin a ton of momentum.\nThere are examples in the early days where we would mess up massive orders. We'd print out colors slightly wrong; it\nwould be the wrong size, and it would be half of our GMV for that month. We would know we got it wrong, and the\ncustomer would be unhappy, and the instinct was to say that it was only a little bit off, not completely wrong, or that it\nwould be fine. But the reality is you just have to bite the bullet and make sure it's right. And the customers who are\noriginally the most frustrated tend to turn into the biggest champions and the longest term users.\nThe last one I want to talk about is finding product/market fit. What I mean by that is the product you launch with will\nalmost certainly not be the product that takes you to scale. So your job in those early days of a startup is to progress and\niterate as fast as possible to reach that product that does have market fit. And as engineers your instinct is building a\nplatform that's beautiful, clean-code, and that scales. You don't want to write a duct tape code that's going to pile on\ntechnical debt. But you need to optimize for speed over scalability and clean code. An example of this is in the early days,\nwe had a couple enterprise customers come in, sort of bigger nonprofits, and say \"Hey, we really like your service, but\nyou're missing these fundamental things, so we're not going to use it.\" And we looked at what it would take to build out\nthose features, and we weren't sure if they were going to work out long-term, but we wanted to try it.\nMy cofounder Evan, who is our CTO and a million times better developer than I am, ran the math and figured out that if we\ndid it the right way, it was going to take about a month to build out these features. A month for a startup \u2013 you live in dog\nyears \u2013 a month is a year, and that just wasn't going to do. So he actually went out and duplicated the code-base,\nduplicated the database, and was able to basically build a completely different product so that he didn't have to worry\nabout the existing users to serve these enterprise customers. We gave them the tool, they on-boarded, and generated a\nlot of revenue. Eventually we learned what features were core, and we integrated them into the core product. But what\nwould've taken a month, we were able to do in three to four days.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4225, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cf3442f-b12a-42c9-aa1e-b968bfc2b5c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cf3442f-b12a-42c9-aa1e-b968bfc2b5c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fda47041-e4df-4332-900c-d094fdbbac17", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "40f90e0b191a36894f8205c801008c835d8ce483a934640bca340f1fb19828bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdd811b5-0302-4a61-95c1-292c059942d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a602d91180859997eb53166535af0ae39ffda1b115760acb8da5e36f8f0b014e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1343ee40-f8ac-4ee9-9f18-5d55c61fe2d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1794a98b8b05d861473d0490bb103d093bc6a7a181ddc8c4d915798b6fcdae48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2e90fb00606be218841af45fa35923ee673cd9e079191e143961c61608552e2b", "text": "My cofounder Evan, who is our CTO and a million times better developer than I am, ran the math and figured out that if we\ndid it the right way, it was going to take about a month to build out these features.

But what\nwould've taken a month, we were able to do in three to four days.\nA great rule of thumb is to only worry about the next order of magnitude, so when you have your tenth user, you shouldn't\nbe wondering how you are going to serve one million users. You should be worried about how you're going to get to 100.\nWhen you're at 100, you should think about 1,000. It's one of those things where necessity is the mother of invention, so\nwhen you hit the breaking point (the Twitter Fail Whale is a great example), and in Teespring there were month-stretches\nwhere every single night the site would crash - every night. Every single person on the team would go to sleep with their\nphone on loud, under their pillows, so inevitably when their phones went off, we could quickly restart the server and go\nback to sleep; this would happen daily. But the reality is that it was worth it, and you'll end up with these huge pain points\nand all this technical debt and regret, but it's worth it just to get to that end goal and that product fit faster.

This is one of your biggest advantages as a company, and the moment you give it up, you're giving your\ncompetitors that are smaller and can still do these things, that advantage over you. So as long as humanly possible, as\nlong as it is a net positive, you need to spend time talking to your users, you need to move as fast as possible in\ndevelopment, but don't give it up willingly; it should be ripped from you.\nTo practice what I preach, I want to give you guys my email address. If you guys have any questions, if you want to learn\nabout Teespring, or if you want to print some T-shirts (fingers-crossed), just shoot me an email. I'd love to help and I'd love\nto speak to you.\nWalker@teespring.com\nThe last thing is, we've created an official \"How to Start a Startup\" T-shirt with Sam. All proceeds are going to Watsi.org. I\ncouldn't miss this opportunity to sell, so if you guys want to grab one of the official tees, just go to teespring.com/startup;\nit's supporting a great cause.\nThank you.\nQ: What convinced you to get into the market of T-shirt printing when there is so much competition in this business?\nA: I think there are two factors to it. First, I completely agree. From the outside, people have been telling us that this is a\nsilly idea since day one in every order magnitude we reach. People will come and say, \"This is a terrible idea. Why are\nyou doing that?\" But the reason why we launched Teespring is because we ran into a personal pain point. We identified\na need and found that there were no great current solutions. I was a student at Brown trying to create a \"Remember the\nBar\" shirt for a dive bar that got shutdown, and I realized that nothing matched my needs. And so because I knew that I\nhad that pain point, and I knew there was market fit, and I had seen people adopt the product, I knew there was\nsomething there. And it was also one of those things where you could sort of feel the wind on your back where people\nwere adopting the product quickly. The pain point was clearly there; it's not a met need. So I would say that most times,\ngreat ideas start out by looking like the silly ideas, and then you can feel out whether or not there is a scalable business\nby how people are adopting it and whether it is possible to bring customers onboard.\nQ: Are nonprofits your biggest customer base?\nA: No, today our biggest customer base is entrepreneurs who are trying to build brands and businesses. We have a little\nover 1000 people who make their full-time living on Teespring today via brands they've launched. And the other side is\ninfluencers, so YouTube stars, Reddit communities, bloggers who want to add product merchandise as a way to create a\nbrand and monetize that affinity. Those are our two biggest markets. We still work with a lot of nonprofits, and love\nworking with them. They are still part of our business, but just not the majority.\nThank you.\nSam Altman: Now we have Justin Kan. Justin was the founder of Kiko, and the Justin.tv which became Twitch. He is\ngoing to talk about Public Relations.\nJustin: I\u2019ve started a lot of start-ups, but I think you've heard a lot of awesome \"how I got started\" stories, so I'm going to\ntalk about something very specific that people always have questions about, which is press: how do you get it and how\ndoes it work? This is kind of like an abridged version of what we talk about at Y Combinator. Hopefully you guys will find it\nhelpful.\nWhen most people get started with entrepreneurship, they think about press and being in the press as something that\nhappens magically. They think about journalists out there, trying to get the best stories - it's like a meritocracy - which is\nabsolutely not the case.\nBefore you think about press, one of the things you really want to consider is who you want to reach, as well as your", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a072565d-d259-4743-85fb-eadc111fbeaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a072565d-d259-4743-85fb-eadc111fbeaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4928bdb5-268f-4156-ad9a-51b20c313250", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "338e629f5f4659e84790b5a725c0208065e91d80f090040ea089fea2886c4f1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1343ee40-f8ac-4ee9-9f18-5d55c61fe2d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1794a98b8b05d861473d0490bb103d093bc6a7a181ddc8c4d915798b6fcdae48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b07b63b4-d3fd-4ea8-af37-f4757dd3f1ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1e388ec990e2cd05e8675a514cf5f0c9b8d4ac9caa78f0b0da4f21e6dbff8d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "45a011518682a834e1c81f98695d40fcbaf51563861d3e990d822fe575c54604", "text": "actual goal. I know when I got started I wanted to be in the news because I thought that's what you did as an important\ncompany. It turns out that if you don't have any goals, you're not going to achieve them - that's true of pretty much\neverything. And with press, if you aimlessly just want to be covered, it's not going to do anything for your startup. If you\ndon't have an actual business goal, then it's not a good use of time.\nSo there are many different goals. With Socialcam, which is a spinoff of Justin.tv, our goal was to be known as like video\nInstagram and be thought of in that context. When it was time to pitch to our Silicon Valley investors and influencers, we\nreally wanted to get covered in tech press and be positioned as this new, hot social app.\nWith Exec one of my goals was to get customers. Exec was like a local cleaning service, and our goal was to get people\nin San Francisco to use it. It wasn't useful to get national press because 99% of those people couldn't use it. So we\ntargeted initially local press like SF Chronicle, who would directly talk to people who could potentially use our app.\nTwitchTV, which is probably what you guys mostly know, is like ESPN for gamers, kind of like a live stream community for\ngamers. Our goal was to reach the gaming industry. Now it's like 55 million uniques and people in the gaming industry\nknow about it, but when we started nobody really knew that; it wasn't a place to advertise, we were a very small gaming\ncommunity. Our goal was to get people in the gaming industry, whether they were developers or advertisers, to think\nabout us as an important place where influencers were. So we really targeted industry trades and game dev blogs. Stuff\nthat the industry was reading.\nSo what's an actual story? I think there's a bunch of different types of stories, but these are the ones you usually see in\nstartups. Product launches are when you launch a different version of your app.\nThere's fundraising; for whatever reason, the press loves to write about fundraising even though it's not very interesting.\nSo like if you raise a million dollar seed round you can pretty much get that covered.\nMilestones are metrics, like if you've achieved one million dollars a week in revenue. The company that bought Exec just\nannounced that they achieved one million dollars a week in revenue, and it was covered pretty widely. Business stories,\nwhich happen when you're already a successful company, The New York Times, The New Yorker, or Business\nMagazine, will want to cover your startup story. You don't have to worry about that in the beginning.\nWhat I like to call stunts - I don't know if you guys remember, but a couples years ago, this YC company called WePay\ndropped a block of ice with money frozen in it outside of a PayPal developer's conference because PayPal was in the\nnews for freezing various developers' account. It was widely covered because it was such an interesting thing, you know,\nit got them in the story, they wouldn't have been talked about in the context of PayPal at all.\nHiring announcements: If you're a big enough company and you hire someone really important, people will want to cover\nthat.\nAnd finally contributor articles which would be you writing some sort of industry overview or some opinion piece, maybe a\ntech blog, stuff like that.\nBasically any of those things can be a story. Something that people usually don't think about when you're trying to start a\nstartup is, when you start a startup, you think that everything you're doing is interesting, but that may not be true for other\npeople. What you really need to think about objectively is, if I wasn't the founder of this company, would I want to read a\nstory about what I'm pitching? So your incremental feature release or your 2.01 feature release might not be interesting\njust because you added \"Find Your Contacts\" on Facebook. You really want to take a step back before you invest the time\nin actually trying to pitch a story, and think, \"Will anyone actually really want to read this?\" What journalists and bloggers\nare really looking for are things that people actually want to read.\nThe other thing is you don't actually have to be very original - your press doesn't have to be original.

You're going to talk to a lot\nof people but not all of them are going to convert \u2013 so you shouldn't be upset when one individual person or reporter\ndoesn't write your story. The first thing is you have to think of it like a story. The second thing is you want to get introduced\nto any reporter or multiple reporters who are going to write about your thing. It's much much easier, just like any business\ndevelopment, to get in touch with them through someone, rather than cold emailing them.\nThe best thing to do is go to entrepreneurs who were just written about or friends who were just covered on TechCrunch,\nget them to introduce you to that reporter who wrote about them. The reason that's good is because from the\nentrepreneur's perspective, the easiest thing in the world to do is to introduce you to the reporter who already wrote about\nthem. They don't need anything else from the reporter, and they're actually doing that person a favor if the story is\ninteresting; it's not like you're asking for intros to investors or people they would want to hire as employees. And then from\nthe reporter's perspective, they're getting introduced to someone who they already vetted as interesting; they're getting an\nintro from someone who they believed was interesting enough to write about, so by the transitive property, they're going\nto think you're probably interesting.\nSo you get an email from this guy who introduces you to the reporter, and you want to get in contact with them with\nenough time to get them to write a story - let them know probably a week in advance or more, because they're not going\nto drop everything they're doing to just write about your news. A lot of people, especially first time entrepreneurs, will\ncome and say \"Justin I'm launching this product tomorrow. Can you get me in TechCrunch?\" That's probably not going to\nhappen unless you already have a relationship. The best thing to do is give yourself some lead time; get that intro in\nadvance.\nSo once you've set a date for your news to go out \u2013 you\u2019re going to launch a product in two weeks - you have this intro,\nyou've set up some sort of meeting, and you really want to get the reporter to invest time and effort into you because\nthere's a sunk cost fallacy at play. Basically, the more time they spend with you, the more likely they are to write about\nyou. The best thing to do is get a face-to-face meeting. Some bloggers don't actually want to meet face-to-face, but like if\nnot that, then get a phone call. The worst thing to do is just have an email exchange because it's very easy for them to\nforget about it or ignore it.\nThe next step is actually pitch them. What I do is actually write out the ideal story that I want to see published in bullet\npoints, and memorize it. And when I have a conversation with them if it's in person, the conversation is structured like my\noutline, and they'll be taking notes. Then they'll go transcribe those notes into a story. So basically what I wrote will be\ntranslated into an actual story. By preparing, you can actually control more of the conversation and not forget critical\nthings like mentioning your cofounder's name or the awesome features in your app are.\nIf I'm doing this over the phone, I'll make sure to have the bullet point list in front of me and I will make sure to walk\nthrough a conversation that includes all those things. So you have a pitch, they take notes, and they're going to write the\nstory at this time. The next thing to do is follow-up like a couple days or day before your actual news goes out. You want\nto send them an email that says \"This is the time we're launching the app; thanks for meeting; here's collateral if there are\nany videos, photos, or screenshot you want to include; how to spell your cofounder's name or your name. I just include all\nthe information that I really care about and bold it. And then that's it. Hopefully the day comes when you press submit on\nthe release to the App Store and at the same time, they released their article on TechCrunch and you are famous.\nSo a lot of people ask us about PR firms.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4313, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2565340d-645c-41f5-a188-aabf26ca38a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2565340d-645c-41f5-a188-aabf26ca38a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "606dc6b9-2121-4a3b-8dc7-e2b3c00b6df8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "12cffb0595d2a3f6a25aaf500b531e81d7e867a0f2de21cd7f2f4251fdd7b404", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1bd5bb8-ae7e-4cfc-a7c9-1764c22c38dd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d3f1e221f3ba0f8969f59e7094a1d276ebeebbe5f69a84594f675fab0d484b58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95d4a86b-0149-4a38-a935-4e5be4fa9f0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c564971921d6c2b597bc2258b2900bcf28e6c4dce06e90c17eb2fae3eb0f8e1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0397bd615e1f2211b2e5c420b73994fc7145e80734e7a9eba287710c8d3548d3", "text": "So you have a pitch, they take notes, and they're going to write the\nstory at this time.

I think we were spending about $5,000 and $20,000 a month, and for various firms, it\u2019s a\nlot - for a startup right? It's generally not a good use of money especially in the early days. Getting press is a lot of work,\nso you should really make sure it's worth it. Getting press is like a vanity metric: It feels like you're being successful\nbecause many successful companies like Facebook are covered in the press all the time, but it doesn't actually mean\nyou're successful; it doesn't actually mean you're making money, getting users, or making those users happy.\nSometimes it's a really good strategy for getting your first hundred or two hundred or a thousand customers, but it's really\nnot a user-scalable acquisition strategy, so it's really something that's just a bootstrap; you can't just get like infinity\narticles written about you. Eventually people are going to get tired of hearing about your company, and usually that\nhappens really quickly right? The pull point about news is that it's new, so it's pretty hard, unless you\u2019re like Google, to get\ncovered in the press every week. If you decide it's worth it though, that you do want to have a regular heartbeat of news,\nyou're thinking about what you're doing that matches those seven story types in the future. When I was working primarily\non marketing and PR, I would make a schedule on the calendar of when we're going to launch things and make sure to\nspace them out, but have them appear at regular intervals so people didn't want to forget about us and we could\nmaximize our coverage.\nYou also want to keep your contacts fresh; it's really a relationship business. Once someone writes about you, you should\nkeep up with them because they could potentially write about you in the future. You're more likely to do something for\nsomeone that you've already done something for in the past. I would try to establish good relationships with a couple\nreporters that you could go to for breaking news; it could come in handy later if you're fortunate enough to have people\nwriting negative things about you; your relationships will help you get out your side of the story.\nThe last thing is kind of like a golden rule or more of like a \"pay it forward:\" You should help your fellow entrepreneurs get\ncoverage because they'll help you get coverage. The best way to get coverage is really through these introductions.\nWhenever I'm meeting with reporters, I throw out names of other things I think would be interesting stories for them, and\nusually that comes back. The reporters like it because you're helping them find interesting stories, and you're more likely\nto get leads back from those entrepreneurs that you helped out.\nIf you're interested in learning more about press, here are two resources that I really like: Jason Kincaid, who is a former\nTechCrunch reporter, goes through a great overview that covers a lot of things I talked about in more depth. And then\nkind of an evil resource is this book called Trust Me, I'm Lying which was written by a former marketer at American\nApparel. He talked about ways that he evilly manipulated the press, but I think it's a pretty good look into the psychology\nof how stories spread on the Internet; it's valuable to take a look at. Cool, that's basically it.\nQ: When is the right time to start worrying about press altogether?\nA: The first time I launched my first startup, you know my first products, for a lot of them we got zero attention and we didn't\nreally know how we could get 100 users. I think it's a really fine way to get 100 users, and a lot of companies at YC when\nthey first launch their product, we'll encourage them to get out and do one TechCrunch story to get a few people to see it.\nIt's good to get in the practice. I wouldn't obsess getting coverage in multiple outlets or anything like that in the very\nbeginning.\nQ: How much of a role did you guys play in getting the Pokemon thing out?\nA: Twitch had this thing called \"Twitch Plays Pokemon\" where developers set up a Pok\u00e9mon Gameboy game that was\ncontrolled by chat, so millions of people would be typing in A or B, and the character would wander around aimlessly.\nThat was a huge news story.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4209, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4c33bcb-73cf-4102-9260-ff4c4112bfbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4c33bcb-73cf-4102-9260-ff4c4112bfbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0a325ab-77be-4b2e-92cf-cf27e88eaf3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "56ac9fff685f918f7bcdfbe212f9b9a4b5c9e793c1f1f1afe8e3e3a0c83c7f39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95d4a86b-0149-4a38-a935-4e5be4fa9f0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "c564971921d6c2b597bc2258b2900bcf28e6c4dce06e90c17eb2fae3eb0f8e1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "151dc703-fbd4-49a5-acd0-2d261cc9cb61", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2726747a4699ee7e2059f0133ea899348b19d8fbae9145358e0a277ea4deba53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fb9f94eb4ccd4269ce58275df29da6530e3780cca3236da7404ccd25167a7a4d", "text": "I think it's a really fine way to get 100 users, and a lot of companies at YC when\nthey first launch their product, we'll encourage them to get out and do one TechCrunch story to get a few people to see it.\nIt's good to get in the practice.

I have been doing\nthis since 1994, right before Marc got out of the University of Illinois, so SV Angel and its entities have invested in over\n700 companies. To invest in 700 companies that means we have physically talked to thousands of entrepreneurs and\nthere is a whole bunch of things that just go through my head when I meet an entrepreneur. I am just going to talk about\nwhat some of those are.\nLiterally while you are talking to me in the first minute I am saying \u201cIs this person a leader?\u201d \u201cIs this person rightful,\nfocused, and obsessed by the product?\u201d I am hoping\u2014because usually the first question I ask is \"What inspired you to\ncreate this product?\"\u2014I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s based on a personal problem that that founder had and this product is the\nsolution to that personal problem. Then I am looking for communication skills, because if you are going to be a leader\nand hire a team, assuming your product is successful, you have to be a really good communicator and you have to be a\nborn leader. Now some of that you may have to learn those traits of leadership but you better take charge and be able to\nbe a leader. I\u2019ll switch back to the slide, but let's let Marc.\nMarc Andreessen: Yeah, I agree with all of that. There is a lot of detail to this question that we can talk about. And we may\nbe a little different than Ron, well we are different than Ron, in that we invest in across stages. We invest in the seed\nstage, the venture stage, growth stage. And then we invest in a variety of business models: consumer, enterprise, and a\nbunch of other variations. There are a bunch of fine grained answers that we could get into if there are specific questions.\nTwo general concepts I would share: one is the venture capital business is one hundred percent a game of outliers, it is\nextreme outliers. So the conventional statistics are in the order of four thousand venture fundable companies a year that\nwant to raise venture capital. About two hundred of those will get funded by what is considered a top tier VC. About fifteen\nof those will, someday, get to a hundred million dollars in revenue. And those fifteen, for that year, will generate\nsomething on the order of 97% of the returns for the entire category of venture capital in that year. So venture capital is\nsuch an extreme feast or famine business. You are either in one of the fifteen or you\u2019re not. Or you are in one of the two\nhundred, or you are not. And so the big thing that we're looking for, no matter which sort of particular criteria we talked\nabout, they all have the characteristics that you are looking for the extreme outlier.\nThe other thing I would highlight that we think about a lot internally, we have this concept, invest in strength versus lack of\nweakness. And at first that is obvious, but it\u2019s actually fairly subtle. Which is sort of the default way to do venture capital is\nto check boxes. So really good founder, really good idea, really good products, really good initial customers. Check,\ncheck, check, check. Okay this is reasonable, I\u2019ll put money in it. What you find with those sort of checkbox deals, and\nthey get done all the time, but what you find is that they often don\u2019t have something that really makes them really\nremarkable and special. They don\u2019t have an extreme strength that makes them an outlier.\nOn the other side of that, the companies that have the really extreme strengths often have serious flaws. So one of the\ncautionary lessons of venture capital is, if you don\u2019t invest in the bases with serious flaws, you don't invest in most of the\nbig winners. And we can go through example after example after example of that. But that would have ruled out almost all\nthe big winners over time. So what we aspire to do is to invest in the startups that have a really extreme strength.

Probably twenty-five percent of the entrepreneurs I\ntalk to today, still after the first sentence, I don\u2019t understand what they do, and as I get older and less patient I say \u201cBackup,\nI don\u2019t even know what you do yet.\u201d So try and get that perfect. And then I want to skip to the second column. You have to\nbe decisive, the only way to make progress is to make decisions. Procrastination is the devil in startups. So no matter\nwhat you do you got to keep that ship moving. If it's decisions to hire, decisions to fire, you got to make those quickly. All\nabout building a great team. Once you have a great product then it\u2019s all about execution and building a great team.\nSam Altman: Parker, could you talk about your seed round and how that went and what you should have done differently\nfor raising money?\nParker Conrad: Sure, actually my seed round, most of the stuff with my current company felt like, from a fundraising\nperspective, felt like it came together relatively quickly. But actually, one of the experiences I had, I started a company\nbefore this that I was at for six years, and my co-founder and I pitched almost every VC firm in Silicon Valley. We literally\nwent to sixty different firms and they all told us no. And we were constantly trying to figure out how should we adjust our\npitch? How should we do the slides differently? How do we tweak the story? That sort of thing. At one point there was this\nkey insight that someone gave me when I was pitching at Khosla Ventures and this VC said \u201cGuys,\" he was looking for\nsome very particular kind of analysis that we did not have on hand, he was like \u201cGuys, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d He was like, \u201cYou\nknow if you guys were the Twitter guys, you guys could come in and just be like blublublubluh and put whatever up here\nand we would invest in you. But you guys aren\u2019t the Twitter guys so you need to make this real easy and have all this stuff\nready for us,\u201d and all this kind of stuff.\nAnd I took the exactly opposite lesson of what he wanted me to take away from that which was: geez I should really just\nfigure out how to be the Twitter guys and that's the way to do this. So actually one of the reasons I started my current\ncompany or one of the things that I found really attractive about Zenefits is, as I was thinking about it, it seemed like a\nbusiness. I was so frustrated from this experience of having tried for two years to raise money from VCs and I sort of\ndecided, to hell with it. You cannot count on there being capital available to you. This business that I started seemed like\none that maybe I could do without raising money at all. There might be a path to kind of, there\u2019s enough cash flow it\nseemed compelling enough that I could do that.\nIt turns out that those are exactly the kinds of businesses that investors love to invest in and it made it incredibly easy. So I\nactually think it seems very kind and I said I was an expert for you guys. I don't actually think I am very good at\nfundraising. It is probably something that I am less good at than other parts of my job. But I think that if you can build the\nbusiness where everything is moving in the right direction, if you could be like the Twitter guys, like nothing else matters,\nand if you can\u2019t be like the Twitter guys, then it is very hard for anything else to make a difference for things to come\ntogether for you.\nRon Conway: Why did that VC say to be like the Twitter guys when the fail whale dominated that site for two years?\nMarc Andreessen: Because it worked.\nRon Conway: The other point I want to make is, bootstrap for as long as you can.

The book is called\n\u201cBorn standing up\u201d, it's a short little book and it describes how he became Steve Martin. And the part of the book is, he\nsays what is the key to success? The key to success is be so good they can't ignore you.\nSo in a sense, we are going to have this whole conversation and I am sure we will keep having it, but it is beside the", "start_char_idx": 3290, "end_char_idx": 4926, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3bb9be1-fe42-41f1-9d3a-e9382c35ed4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3bb9be1-fe42-41f1-9d3a-e9382c35ed4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5d10ee9-d1ca-4b60-aaa1-02da2b54875f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e76a725e30c4d021c2df80f4fccb3a532493476f501b31c730cf860484ffd094", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f240519-6814-4791-8b4f-3539803bbd57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a0be59e3eacf76f5b23263d24768e46016fcf25589a50193af6936846fae3703", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "030ba575-6113-489d-94c2-12de6c792ffa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32e69df3ad8958c47f73b7588a1452ea7af2e8407931490938c659597c78ced8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1765081b1b0bff8d8414775f16e0797565678c1f41d467456c5d7d92b6a53809", "text": "point, because if you do as Parker has done and you build a business that is going to be a gigantic success then\ninvestors are throwing money at you. And if you come in with a theory and a plan and no data and you are just one of the\nnext thousand, it's going to be far, far harder to raise money. So that is the positive way to put it, is to be so good they can\u2019t\nignore you. You are almost always better off making your business better than you are making your pitch better.\nThe other thing, that's the positive way to look at it, the negative way or the cautionary lesson is that, and this gets me in\ntrouble every single time I say it, but I am on a ton of flu medications so I am going to go ahead and just let it rip, raising\nventure capital is the easiest thing a startup founder is ever going to do. As compared to recruiting engineers, recruiting\nengineer number twenty. It\u2019s far harder than raising venture capital. Selling to large enterprise is harder, getting viral\ngrowth going on a consumer business is harder, getting advertising revenue is harder. Almost everything you'll ever do is\nharder than raising venture capital. So I think Parker is exactly right, if you get in the situation where raising the money is\nhard, it's probably not hard compared to all the other stuff that is about to follow. It is very important to bear that in mind.\nIt\u2019s often said that raising money is not actually a success, it's not actually a milestone for a company and I think that is\ntrue. And I think that is the underlying reason, it puts you in a position to do all the other harder things.\nSam Altman: Related to that. What do you guys wish founders did differently when raising money? And specifically, Marc,\nyou mentioned this relationship between money and funding?\nMarc Andreeseen: I think the single biggest thing that people are just missing and I think it\u2019s all of our faults, we are all not\ntalking about it enough, but I think the single biggest thing entrepreneurs are missing both on fundraising and how they\nrun their companies is the relationship between risk and cash. So the relationship between risk and raising cash, and\nthen the relationship between risk and spending cash. So I have always been a fan of something that Andy Rachleff\ntaught me years ago, which he calls the onion theory of risk. Which basically is, you can think about a startup like on day\none, as having every conceivable kind of risk and you can basically make a list of the risks. So you\u2019ve got founding team\nrisks, are the founders going to be able to work together; then you have product risk, can you build the product; you will\nhave technical risk, maybe you need a machine learning breakthrough or something. Are you going to have something to\nmake it work, or are you going to be able to do that? You will have launch risk, will the launch go well; you will have\nmarket acceptance risk, you will have revenue risk. A big risk you get into with a lot of businesses that have a sales force,\nis that can you actually sell the product for enough money to actually pay for the cost of sales? So you have cost of sales\nrisk. If you are a consumer product, you have viral growth risk. So a startup at the very beginning is just this long list of\nrisks, right, and the way I always think about running a startup is also how I think about raising money. Which is a process\nof peeling away layers of risk as you go.\nSo you raise seed money in order to peel away the first two or three risks, the founding team risk, the product risk, maybe\nthe initial watch risk. You raise the A round to peel away the next level of product risk, maybe you peel away some of the\nrecruiting risk because you get your full engineering team built. Maybe you peel away some of your customer risk\nbecause you get your first five customers. So basically the way to think about it is, you are peeling away risk as you go,\nyou are peeling away your risk by achieving milestones. And as you achieve milestones, you are both making progress\nin your business and you are justifying raising more capital. Right?\nSo you come in and pitch to someone like us. And you say you are raising a B round. And the best way to do that with us\nis to say I raised a seed round, I achieved these milestones. I eliminated these risks.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4280, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "030ba575-6113-489d-94c2-12de6c792ffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "030ba575-6113-489d-94c2-12de6c792ffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5d10ee9-d1ca-4b60-aaa1-02da2b54875f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e76a725e30c4d021c2df80f4fccb3a532493476f501b31c730cf860484ffd094", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3bb9be1-fe42-41f1-9d3a-e9382c35ed4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1765081b1b0bff8d8414775f16e0797565678c1f41d467456c5d7d92b6a53809", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3b71ead-769a-43b5-ad84-9751143958de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7378993b25234e32f24478fff33e01dbc701c8ee57965f235ed8e1b5c0602c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "32e69df3ad8958c47f73b7588a1452ea7af2e8407931490938c659597c78ced8", "text": "You raise the A round to peel away the next level of product risk, maybe you peel away some of the\nrecruiting risk because you get your full engineering team built.

For sure don't ask people to sign an NDA. We rarely get asked any more because\nmost founders have figured out that if you ask someone for a NDA at the front end of the relationship you are basically\nsaying, I don't trust you. So the relationship between investors and founders involves lots of trust. The biggest mistake I\nsee by far is not getting things in writing.

It is the tiniest step on the way as Marc said. And it's the most fundamental. Hurry up and get it over with.\nBut in the process, when somebody makes the commitment to you, you get in your car, and you type an email to them that\nconfirms what they just said to you. Because a lot of investors have very short memories and they forget that they were\ngoing to finance you, that they were going to finance or they forget what the valuation was, that they were going to find a\nco-investor. You can get rid of all that controversy just by putting it in writing and when they try and get out of it you just\nresend the email and say excuse me. And hopefully they have replied to that email anyways so get it in writing. In\nmeetings take notes and follow up on what\u2019s important.\nSam Altman: I want to talk a little more about tactics here. Just how does the process go? Can people email you directly\nor do they need to get an introduction? And how many meetings does it take to make a decision? How do you figure out\nwhat the right terms are? When can a founder ask you for a check?\nMarc Andreessen: That was six questions. It was a lot of things. Why don't you describe, you will describe seed then I will\ndescribe-\nRon Conway: Yeah so, SV Angel invests in seed stage startups, so we like to be the very first investor. We normally invest\ntoday at around the million to two million. It used to only be a million. So if we invest two hundred and fifty k, that means\nthere\u2019s five or six other investors in that syndicate. SV Angel has now a staff of thirteen people. I do no due diligence\nanymore, I am not a picker anymore. I just help on major projects for the portfolio companies that are starting to mature.\nBut we have a whole team that processes. We, at SV Angel, end up investing in one company for every thirty that we look\nat, and we end up investing at about one a week.\nI think what\u2019s interesting is, we don't really take anything over the transome. Our network is so huge now that we basically\njust take leads from our own network. We evaluate the opportunity, which means you have to send in a really great short\nexecutive summary and if we like that, we actually vote, although I am not in this meeting anymore, but the group actually\ntakes a vote on do we make this phone call. That's how important time is in this process. And if enough of the team at SV\nthinks it's interesting then they appoint a person to make a phone call to that founder. Usually somebody on our team that\nhas domain experience. If the phone call goes well, bingo! We want to meet you. If SV Angel asks you for a meeting, we\nare well on our way to investing. If that meeting goes well, we\u2019ll do some background checks, back door background\nchecks, get a good feeling about the company, the market that they are going after and then make the commitment to\ninvest. And then start helping get other value-add investors to be part of the syndicate. Because if we are going to have\nan equal workload we want the other investors in this company to be great angel investors as well.\nMarc Andreessen: Okay, so I will talk a little about the venture stage, the Series A stage. I think it\u2019s fair to say at this point,\nthe top tier venture capitalists only invest in two kinds of companies at the Series A stage. One is if they have previously\nraised a seed round. So it's almost always the case when we are doing a Series A investment for the company when the\ncompany has a million or two million in seed financing, from Ron and the folks that he likes to work with. Almost always\nRon, just to be clear and folks he likes to work with.

One is if they have previously\nraised a seed round. So it's almost always the case when we are doing a Series A investment for the company when the\ncompany has a million or two million in seed financing, from Ron and the folks that he likes to work with. Almost always\nRon, just to be clear and folks he likes to work with. So if you are going Series A, the first thing you to do is to raise seed,\nthat is generally the way the progression works at this point. Every once in a while we will go straight to a company that\nhasn\u2019t raised a seed round. Really the only times when that happens is when it is a founder who has been a successful\nfounder in the past and is almost certainly somebody we have worked with in the past.\nSo actually, we have not announced, but we just did one of these we will announce in a few weeks where it was a\nfounder, I was an Angel investor, actually I think Ron was also in the company in 2006. Then the company did it's thing\nand ultimately was acquired by another big company. And now that team is now starting new things. So in that case we\nare just going to jump it straight to an A. Because they are so well known and they have a plan all lined up for it. That's the\nexception, it\u2019s almost always preceded by a seed round. The other thing is, I mentioned this already, but we get similar to\nwhat Ron said, about two thousand referrals a year through our referral network. A very large percentage of those are\nreferrals through the seed investors. So by far the best way to get the introductions to the A stage venture firms is to work\nthrough the seed investors. Or work through something like Y Combinator.\nSam Altman: Speaking of terms. What term should founders care most about?

They\u2019re going to make the\nright introductions, and I think there is an enormous difference in the quality of an introduction. So if you can get a really\ngood introduction from an someone that the venture capitalist really trusts and respects, the likelihood that that is going to\ngo well is so much higher than a lukewarm introduction from someone they don't know as well. So the seed stage,\nprobably the best thing you can do is find the right investors and then-\nSam Altman: How does the founder know who the right investors are?\nParker Conrad: Well, I think it\u2019s really hard. I think one of the best ways, and not to give a plug to YC, is YC does a very\ngood job at telling you who they think those people are. And can really direct you towards, and I actually found it to be\npretty accurate in terms of who you guys have said were going to be the best people, they ended up being the most\nhelpful as we were raising subsequent rounds that provided the best introductions. The people who I thought seemed\nokay, but were not as highly rated by YC that ended up being the case that they were real duds in the seed round.\nSam Altman: Someday we are going to publish some of these people-\nParker Conrad: Oh gosh there are going to be a lot of upset people if you do.\nSam Altman: So how do you think about negotiation? How do you figure out what the right evaluation of their company\nshould be, what are the terms?\nParker Conrad: Well when I was starting out, I was raising my seed round and I didn\u2019t really know. I mean, we had\nconversations about this. I probably started a little too high on the valuation side. As you guys know, Y Combinator starts\nthis thing called Demo Day. You get all these sort of investors at once who are looking at the company. I started out trying\nto raise money for a twelve or fifteen million dollar cap. Which is not quite the same thing as a valuation but roughly the\nequivalent. And everyone thought that was crazy, you know, that's completely nuts. You are too big for your britches, that\ncompletely just wouldn't work. So I started working it down a little bit. Within the space of a couple days I decided I was\ngoing to raise at nine, and for some reason that hit some magical threshold on the seed stage that it was below ten that it\nseemed that there was almost infinite demand for the round at a nine million cap. So no one would pay twelve but at a\nnine million dollar cap it felt like I could have raised ten million dollars. And the round came together in roughly about a\nweek at that point, once I hit that threshold.\nThere seemed to be, and they fluctuate over time, these thresholds particularly for seed stage companies that investors\nthink that above this level is crazy, it doesn\u2019t matter. And there is a rough kind of range that people are willing to pay. You\njust have to figure out what that is. Just get the money that you need, don't raise any more than you need. And just get it\ndone. At the end of the day, whether you raise a twelve, a nine, or a six, it's not a huge deal for the rest of the company.\nSam Altman: Is there a maximum in the company that you think founders should sell in their seed round, their A round?\nBeyond what Paul was talking about.\nParker Conrad: I don't know the rules on this stuff. The tricky thing is, it seems like they are particularly rough for a Series\nA. You are probably going to sell somewhere between twenty to thirty percent of the company. Below, venture capitalist\ntend to be a lot more ownership focused than price focused. So you might find that it's actually, when companies raise\nreally big rounds it is because the investors says, \"Hey listen, I am not going to go below twenty percent ownership but I\nwill pay more for it.\" Above thirty percent, probably weird things happen with the cap table, like it gets hard, you know,\ndown the line for there to be a firm on the cap table for everyone.

You are the ones doing all the work.\nMarc Andreessen: We'll actually, we'll walk. We have seen a series of interesting companies in the last five years that,\nwhere we just walk, we won't bid simply on the basis that their cap table is already destroyed. Outside investors already\nown too much. There is a company we really wanted to invest in, but the outside investors already owned eighty percent\nof it when we talked to them. And it was a relatively young company, they just had done two early rounds that sold too\nmuch of the company. Literally, we were worried, and accurately so, it was going to be demotivating for the team to have\nthat structure.\nSam Altman: One more question before we open up for the audience to ask questions. For Ron and for Marc. Could you\nboth tell a story about the most successful investment you ever made and how that came to happen?\nParker Conrad: Other than Zenefits.\nRon Conway: For me clearly, it was the investment in Google in 1999. And we got a googol return out of it. Funny\nenough, I meet Google through a Stanford professor David Cheriton, who is in the school of engineering and he is still\nhere. He was actually an angel investor in Google and an investor in our fund. Kind of the quid pro quo we have with our\ninvestors in the fund is you have to tell us about any interesting companies that you see. We loved it that David Cheriton\nwas an investor in our fund because he had access to the computer science departments deal flow. And we were at this\nparty at Vivek Wadhwa's house in full tuxedo, I hate tuxedos, does anyone here know David Cheriton? Because you\nknow for sure he does not like tuxedos and he was in a tuxedo. But I went up to him and we complained about our attire.\nThen I said, hey what's happening at Stanford? And he said, well there is this project called backrub, and it's search. It's\npage search by page rank and relevancy.\nToday everyone says pagerank and relevancy is obvious. Back in 1998 that was not obvious, that engineers were\ndesigning a product based on this thing called pagerank. All it was was a simple algorithm that said if a lot of people go to\nthat website and other websites direct them there, there must be something good happening on that website. That was\nthe original algorithm. The motivation was relevance. So I said to David, I have to meet these people. He said, you can't\nmeet them until they\u2019re ready. Which was the following May funny enough, I waited, I called them every month for five\nmonths. And finally got my audition with Larry and Sergey. Right away they were very strategic. They said, they we'll let\nyou invest if you can get Sequoia, we don't know Sequoia but they are investors in Yahoo and because we are late to\nmarket, but we want to know we have a deal with Yahoo. So I earned my way into the investment in Google.\nMarc Andreessen: I will tell one on the other side, which is Airbnb, which we were not early investors in, Airbnb is a\ngrowth round, we did the first big growth round under Airbnb at about a billion dollar valuation in 2011. And I think that\nwill turn out to be, I believe that will turn out to be one of the spectacular growths of all time. I think this will really be a\ngreat company, so I will tell that story because it is not a story of pure genius.\nWe passed. I don't think we even met with them the first time around, or maybe one of our junior people did. I said earlier\nthat venture capital is entirely a game of outliers. One of the key things of outliers is that their ideas often seem outright\nnuts up front. So of course having a website where you can have other people stay in your house, if you made a list of the\nideas that were the most nuts that would be right there at the top. Well the second most stupid idea you can think of is\nhaving a website where you can stay at other people\u2019s houses. Airbnb deeply combines both of those bad ideas.

The other thing I will highlight on, the other reason we pulled the trigger\nat a high valuation when we did was because we had spent time at that point with the founders, with Bryan, with Joe, and\nwith Nate.

How are they going to be at running this giant global\noperation? We were just tremendously impressed and are today every time we deal with all three of those guys; how\nmature they are, how much that are progressing. It's like they get more and more mature, they get better and better\njudgement, and they get more and more humble as they grow. So that made us feel really good, that not just was this\nbusiness going to grow, but that these were guys who were going to be able to build something and be able to run it in a\nreally good way.\nRon Conway: You know, people always ask me, why do you think Airbnb is going to be such a great company? Its funny,\nwe are obsessing over Airbnb. It\u2019s because all three founders are as good as the other founder. That is very rare. In the\ncase of Google, two founders, one of them is a little better than the other... hey, he is the CEO. Every company has a CEO.\nWhy am I saying this? When you start a company, you have to go find somebody as good or better than you to be the co-\nfounder. If you do that, your chance of success grow astronomically. And that is why Airbnb became so successful, so\nquickly. The anomaly is Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. Yes he has an awesome team, but the Mark Zuckerberg\nphenomenon where is it one person, is the outlier. So when you start a company, you have got to find phenomenal co-\nfounders.\nSam Altman: Okay, audience members.\nQ: So obviously the conventional wisdom of why you raise money is you need it. But the more I get off conventional\nwisdom the more I hear another story on why you raise money. I am actually hearing founders say it is more to facilitate\nthe big exit. Or in the worse case the acqui-hire instead of fizzling out into nothing. To what extent is that accurate\nthinking?\nRon Conway: Well if you pick good investors who have good rolodexes and good domain expertise in what your\ncompany does, they are going to add a lot more value than the money. Those are the types of investors you should be\nlooking for.\nMarc Andreessen: So the answer to the question is yes but in a sense it doesn't matter. Because you can not plan these\nthings according to the downside. I mean that is the scenario that you are obviously not hoping for. While the answer is\nyes, that should probably not play into the decision making process too much, it might enter into which investor to raise\nmoney from, it probably doesn't enter into the whether to raise money question that much.\nQ: If you intend to start a business that is capital equipment intensive, do you guys have any advice on how to deal with\ndemotivation? So not everything starts in software, viral, or anything else? What should founders do for capital equipment\nintensive companies?\nMarc Andreessen: I would double down on my previous comments on the onion theory of risk and the staging of risk and\ncash. Which is the more capital has the business, the more intense you have to be about exactly what is going to be\nrequired to make a business work and what the staging of milestones and risks are. In that case you want to line up, you\nwant to be very precise on lining up, because the risk is so high that it will all go sideways, right? You want to be very\nprecise on what you can accomplish with your A round and what is going to be a successful execution of your A round. If\nyou raise too much money in your A round that will seriously screw you up, right, later on down the road. Because you\nare going to raise a C seed then the accumulative dilution will get to be too much. So you have to be precise on every\nsingle round, you have to raise as close to the exact amount of money as possible. Then you have to be as pure and\nclean and precise with the investors as you can possibly be about the risks and the milestones.\nThis, by the way, is a big thing.

So it's a\nthread the needle process. The demands are just a more advanced level of management than the next Snapchat.\nQ: What is a sign you should not work with an investor?\nRon Conway: Well it is the inverse of what I said about a good investor. If it is an investor that has no domain expertise in\nyour company, does not have a rolodex where they can help you with introductions both for business development and in\nhelping you do the intros for Series A, you should not take that person\u2019s money. Especially if they are in it just to make\nmoney. And you can sus those people out pretty quickly.\nMarc Andreessen: I'm glad you asked this question because it brings up a larger point. If your company is successful, at\nleast the ones we want to invest in want to build big franchise companies, so we are talking about a ten or fifteen or\ntwenty year journey. Ten, fifteen, or twenty years you may notice is longer than the average American marriage. This is\nsignificant. The choice of key investors, of particular investors who are going to be on the board for a company, I think is\njust as important as who you get married to, which is extremely important. These are people you are going to be living\nwith, partnering with, relying on, and dealing with in positions, in conditions of great stress and anxiety for a long period of\ntime.\nThis is the big argument I always make, and I make it all the time, sometimes people believe it, sometimes they don't. If\neverything goes great, it doesn't matter who your investors are. But almost never does everything always go great. Even\nthe big successful companies, even Facebook, all these big companies that are now considered to be very successful, all\nalong the way all kinds of shit hit the fan over, and over, and over, and over again. There are any number of stressful\nboard meetings and discussions, and late-night meetings with the future of the company at stake where everyone really\nneeds to be on the same team and have the same goals, be pulling at the same direction, have a shared understanding,\nhave the right kind of ethics, and the right kind of staying power to actually weather the storms that come up.\nAnd one of the things you will find is a big difference for first time founders versus second time founders is almost always\nthe second time founders take that point much more seriously after they have been through it once. So it really, really,\nreally matters who your partner is. It really is like getting married, and it really is worth putting the same amount, maybe\nnot the quite as much time and effort as picking your spouse, but it is worth spending significant time really understanding\nwho you are about to be partnered with. That is way more important than did I get another five million in the valuation\norder, or another two million dollars in the check.\nRon Conway: I know at SV Angel, our attitude is if you invest in an entrepreneur, we are investing for life. Because if we\nmade the right decision, we are going to invest in every company they start. Once an entrepreneur, always an\nentrepreneur. We actually do consider it a marriage.\nParker Conrad: I always look for, in that first meeting, do you feel like you respect this person and do you feel like you\nhave a lot to learn from this person?

I would rather just add more value to the existing companies. SV Angel does\nhave a written conflict policy. But when we do end up with a conflict, it is usually because one company has morphed into\nanother space. We don\u2019t normally invest in companies that have a direct conflict. If we do, we disclose it to the other\ncompany, to both companies, and keep in mind at our stage, we don\u2019t know the company's product strategy anyway. We\nprobably don\u2019t know enough to disclose, but our conflict policy also talks about this really important word which is trust. In\nother words, we are off to a bad start if we don\u2019t trust each other. With SV Angel, the relationship between the founder and\nus is based on trust. If someone doesn\u2019t trust us, they shouldn\u2019t work with us.\nMarc Andreessen: Let me go back to the original question. This is the question that is talked about most in our firm. So the\nmain constraint on a top-tier venture capital firm is the concept of opportunity cost. It's the concept that means everything\nyou do, there are a whole bunch of other things that you can\u2019t do. It's not so much the cost of we invest five million dollars\ninto the company, the company goes wrong and we lose the money. That\u2019s not really the loss that we are worried about\nbecause the theory is we'll have the winners that will make up for that.\nThe cost we worry about is, every investment we make has two implications for how we run the firm. Number one rules on\nconflicts. So our policy for sure on venture and growth rounds is that we don't invest in conflicting companies. We only\ninvest in one company in a category. So if we invest in MySpace, and Facebook comes along a year later, we are out. We\ncan't do it. Every investment we make locks us out of a category. And the nature, that is a very complicated topic when\nwe\u2019re discussing these things internally. You only know the companies that already exist, you don't know the companies\nthat haven\u2019t been founded yet. And god help you if you invested in an early company that was not going to be the winner\nand you were locked out by the time the winner came along.\nThe other issue is opportunity cost on the time and bandwidth of the general partners. Going back to the concept of\nadding value, we are a general firm, we have official partners. A partner can maybe be on ten to twelve boards in total if\nthey are completely, fully loaded. Basically you want to think of it as a ticket that you have a limited number of holes you\ncan punch, every time you make an investment you punch a hole. When you are out of holes to punch, you are done, you\ncan't make any new investments. That is very much how venture capital operates. A way to look at it is, every board slot\nthat our GP\u2019s have at any given time is an asset to the firm. They can be deployed against an opportunity. But every time\nwe make an investment, it takes the number of slots we can punch down by one. So it reduces the ability for the firm to do\nnew deals. Every investment we make forecloses not just the competitive set but other deals that we will simply run out of\ntime. This goes back to what I said earlier. This company is fairly good, it seems fairly obvious that it's going to get venture\nfunding, why didn't you fund it? Well, on its own, if we had unlimited capacity, we probably would have, but relative to\ngetting blocked by a competitive set, and not having that board seat for an even better opportunity, we pass on that basis\na lot.\nQ: What would convince you to invest in a company with no product to show.

I\nthink it removes the fear, creates a little more trust. It removes the fear that someone is going to come in and fire you\narbitrarily because it's time for a big company CEO. But in most cases if you trust the people you are working with, it\nshouldn't really be an issue. Things almost never come to a board vote, and by the time they do it's something is deeply\nbroken at that point any way. Most of the power that VCs have is outside of the board structure. There are protective\ncovenants that are built into the financing round, you can't take on debt, you can't sell the company, there are certain\nthings you can't do without them agreeing to it anyway.\nIt's less of a big deal than people make it out to be. What I found, as a founder, if things are going well at the company,\nyou have unlimited power vis a vis your investors. No matter what the board structure is, no matter the convenants in the\nround. If you say, this is what I want to do, I think this is what we need to do. Even if it's a good investor, or a bad investor,\nthey are like, let's make it happen. They want to ride this rocketship with you, and when things go badly it doesn't matter\nwhat protections you have built into the system for yourself.\nMarc Andreessen: When a company gets in dire straights, it doesn't matter what the terms for the prior round are, they all\nget renegotiated. I have been on boards for twenty years, I have never been in an important board vote that mattered. It's\nnever been a vote, many discussions, many controversies, never a vote. The decision has always been clear by the end.\nIt's almost always unanimous.

So, you are here, you have been following the presentations, so you\nknow how to get started. You have built a team, you know how to build your product, it\u2019s off the ground, it's growing.\nPeople love it, you figured out how to do that. You figured out to create a special one of a kind company with monopoly\npowers, that\u2019s big. And the market you are chasing after is slightly bigger than the paper airplane business, so you are\ngood, right? So now what?\nSo we are here to submit that actually culture is the thing that is actually going to be very, very important to scale the\nbusiness as well as your team. And hopefully, after this talk you will be able to know: What is culture? Why does it matter?\nHow do you create your core values? And think about elements that fit together for core values and culture that create a\nhigh performance team. Get some best practices for the culture.\nWhat is culture? Anybody want to take a guess at how one should define this? {Simple values in a team?} Yeah, that\u2019s\ngood. Did you look that up because you had a computer and an internet connection? These are some definitions that you\nwill find in Webster\u2019s dictionary but we are Stanford. This is kind of a trick question. It\u2019s a CS class, the questions are\nnever straight forward.\nThe real question is, what is the company culture going to be. Culture, we can generally talk about society, about groups,\nabout places, or things. Here we're talking about company culture. So how does one define company culture? We can\ntake the previous definition and modify it a little bit. This is a hint of how we may want to define company culture. Every\nday blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank. Some people have filled these in with\ndifferent things. The first blank, A, could be assumptions, beliefs, values, now my favorite is core values. The second\nblank for the B blank, people said behavior, my favorite is action. How do you act? In pursuit of goals, that\u2019s kind of weak,\nin pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals is a little stronger, but a better definition is in the pursuit of mission.\nSo now that we have that definition, what do we do with that and why does it matter? This is a quote from Gandhi \u201cYour\nbeliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions\nbecome the habits. Your habits become your values. And your values become your destiny.\u201d If you don't have a good\nculture in the company you can\u2019t pursue your destiny.\nWhy it matters is that it becomes the first principles you sort of go back to when you make decisions. It becomes a way to\nalign people on values that matter to the company. It provides a certain level of stability to fall back on. And it provides\nlevel of trust, people sort of trust each other with, but it also gives us a list with which you should be able to figure out what\nto do and what not to do. And what the more important thing about that is what not to do. Then finally the other thing that is\nimportant is it allows you to retain the right employees. There are people in this world that are not going to be a fit for your\ncompany, but if you have good strong culture, and the strong core values, you'll know who you want to retain and who\nyou truly do not want to retain. And if you take the first letter of those it happens to help you move faster.\nAnother reason, you're thinking that's like all mushy stuff, this is actually more scientific stuff.

Who are the types of people you like working with? And what are their values?\nAnd through that you distill together what a set of values are. Think about all the people that you've never liked working\nwith. What values do they have? Think of the opposite of that. Maybe those should be considered values for your\ncompany. Finally remember the values have to support your mission and if they don't support your mission, you\u2019re\nmissing something. Then the last final checks are they have to be creditable, they have to be uniquely tied to match your\nmission. So at Zappos, in terms of uniquely applied to the mission, we were focused on creating a culture that was going\nto provide great customer service. So the first core value we had, was to deliver wow through service. We are very\nspecific that we wanted to deliver great customer service and it was going to be a wow experience. And then below that\nwe wanted to serve.\nI had a paragraph talking about what we mean by that, we wanted to support them, doing the wow through service, and\nsupport people such as our employees, our customers, our brand partners, and investors. On terms of the opposite thing,\nwe generally didn\u2019t like working with arrogant people, so one of our core values at Zappos was to be humble. So those\nare two examples where we create core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission.\nSo you go through this process, you come up with a few core values, these might be some of them, whether it's honesty,\nintegrity, service, teamwork. It might be a list, you might start with three, might end up with a list of ten, you might have a\nlist of thirty. It\u2019s a good start. When Zappos went through this process we asked all the employees at the time what core\nvalues they can identify with and they came up with thirty-seven. We whittled that down to about ten. And it took a year to\ndo this, that's a long time and you might want to ask why. Well if you just come up with the word honesty, give me a break,\neverybody wants the culture to be honest, nobody is going to say I want to be lied to every day.\nService, what do you mean by service? There\u2019s got to be a lot more depth in this than that. And everybody talks about\nteamwork, but there's a difference in level of teamwork that you see in an intramural sports team vs a baseball team. How\ndo you dive deeper into teamwork? What are the things that don't work for a team? A lot of it has to do with\ncommunication, a lot has to do with things that people of study, and you may one go deeper into that. At Zappos we\nthought about, well there are a lot of smart people in this room. When they're fighting with each other and trying to figure\nout who's right and who's not, it\u2019s probably not the best use of time. We wanted everyone to build off each other and help\neach other make any idea better. The result is that the company gets a better idea, not that any individual person is right.\nSo we wanted to make and still, this idea that it's company first, then your department, then your the team, then yourself.\nAnd how do you do that?\nWe are going to go a level deeper in that. There's another great element of high performing teams that I really like. Which\nis this pyramid that was created by Patrick Lencioni, and he wrote this book, \u201cThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team.\u201d And the\nreason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of the team. A lot of teams break down because they have no\ntrust and even if you had trust, why do you need trust? If you have trust, you can actually have debates and conflict and\nget to the right answer. If you don't have conflicts and debate, it's the blind leading the blind. How do you actually know\nyou got to the right answer before you commit to something?

I think that is a big, big no no. I think you can have the smartest engineer in the world but if they don't believe the\nmission they are not going to pour their heart and soul into it.

Everybody\nwants to provide great customer service, every company wants to have great culture. What they fail to do is make it a daily\nhabit. You just can't be fit, if you don't do it as a daily habit. Eventually you get out of shape, then you get fat, and then you\nsay, Oh I have to go on a crash diet to get back into shape. That doesn't quite work, and the same is true with something\nlike culture. So I think we checked all of these off, so we can go into Q and A with Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Hello everybody. It\u2019s quiet in here, I'll be honest, now I feel a little less on edge. Nothing worse than a room\nfull of people really, really quiet staring at you, but now I feel better.\nAlfred Lin: Well I did it for five or ten minutes, you can do it a little longer. So Brian, could you talk about the process by\nwhich you came to understand that culture was important to AirBnB and building a company?\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, so I think one of the things we realized is, to just give you, I won\u2019t tell the full story of how Airbnb\ncame to be. Some of you may know it. So here\u2019s the very short version the story, Airbnb wasn't meant to be the company\nwe were trying to start. I quit my job, I was living in LA. One day I drove to San Francisco, became roommates with my\nfriend from college, from the Rhode Island School of Design, Joe Gebbia, and I had one thousand dollars in the bank and\nthe rent was one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars. So that weekend this international design convention was\ncoming to San Francisco, all the hotels were sold out, so we decided to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for the\nconference. I didn\u2019t have a bed, Joe had three air beds, we pulled them out of the closet and called it The Air Bed and\nBreakfast. That's how the company started.\nI recall the story ten thousand times by the way, some version of that story, and I didn't think I'd ever tell that a second\ntime. I remember growing up, I also went to college, my parents were social workers and never thought about me going to\nart school. They had worried that maybe I would not get a job after college, which I\u2019m sure most parents worry about.\nMake sure you promise me you get a job with health insurance, I end up starting Airbnb. I remember her telling me, I\nguess you never got the job with health insurance.\nThe reason I say this though is, Airbnb was never meant to be the big idea. It was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so\nwe could think of the big idea. Along the way, by solving our problem it became the big idea. So alongside that, we won\u2019t\ntouch on how we built a product, that's probably another conversation that's being talked about, you have to build a team\nand a great company. And in the early days, we had three co-founders, Joe, Nate, and myself. I think of one of the\nreasons we're successful was that I was really lucky. I don't think it was really lucky to pick up the idea Airbnb and I don\u2019t\nthink we were lucky to be successful once we had a team. I think we could have come up with a lot of other ideas and\nbeen just as successful. I think I was lucky in that I found two great people that I wanted to start up a business with, people\nI admired. That almost intimidated me by how smart they were. I think that's what the first thing is, to build a team that is so\ntalented that they kind of, slightly make you uncomfortable to be with them, because you know you are going to have to\nraise your game to be with them.\nAnd then when we were working together in the early days, this is 2008, the first thing is we were like a family. You think\nabout founders like parents and the company like a child. That child will manifest in many ways, behaviors that parents\nhave in the relationship. If the parents are functional but not working together then the child is, frankly, going to be pretty\nfucked up. You don\u2019t want that. You want your culture to be awesome.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "184520f9-e918-4e8d-b83c-a5a43a00e50c": {"__data__": {"id_": "184520f9-e918-4e8d-b83c-a5a43a00e50c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de22621a-571b-46f4-8d51-cc7d51fd4387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "74f0dc19a79c56ffd7dbd36fc31dc9c816d36bf3cfb1513d551302ed903689ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e4229ab-ec18-4856-881c-d9bde5ce70f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "9c855c4635456efe3cf255f8a05f26b6ce6eb9d398057a83416ae619bbc43cde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a557681-93c9-4a74-9e73-2b8fa821c97f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bcb7f12f7c26e69e88667c2b546f157b44ca332f31373c36a511e82236f383a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cb2aad84af210eb0add8d459d7d118459acb6e460c9b74b0bd7d4fea24b58169", "text": "I think I was lucky in that I found two great people that I wanted to start up a business with, people\nI admired.

And so Joe, Nate, and I were a total family the\nbeginning, we usually worked eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. I remember when we were at Y Combinator, we\nworked together, we ate food together, or even went to the gym together. We may as well have gotten jumpsuit, we didn\u2019t\ngo that far. It was like we were a mission, a special force.\nWe had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability, and that was the DNA of a company. And\nthen we were thinking, at some point you build the product to phase two, which is building the company that builds the\nproduct. So a lot of the talk is about how to build a product, how to get product market fit. Once people do that, now you\nhave to build a company. It doesn't matter how great your original product idea is, if you cannot build a great company\nthen your product will not endure. As we thought about this, we realized we wanted to build a company for the long term.\nWe wanted a company that would endure. To do that, we started noticing companies have something in common.\nCompanies around for a really long time had a clear mission.

And so Joe, Nate, and I, when we were three people,\ndecided to look around at companies. I noticed Apple, Steve Jobs\u2019 core value was that he believed people with passion\ncould change the world. He said our products change but our value never has. We learned about Amazon, we learned\nabout Nike, we learned about companies in the early days. You can even use this to talk about nations. Even a nation\nhas core values and a declaration so that the nation may endure longer. We started to realize that we needed to have\nintention, culture needs to be designed. And that is how we got connected. Because we were funded by Sequoia, Alfred\njust joined them with Zappos, and I was told Zappos had an amazing culture. We went to Las Vegas and met up with\nTony and we learned about it.\nAlfred Lin: So what did you learn?\nBrian Chesky: Well, you guys are crazy. The thing we learned, and we were three people, was if culture is a way of doing\nthings, there really are two arts. One is behaviors and those can change maybe fifty years from now. There will be rituals\nand behaviors that change, be different. But there have to be some things that never change. Some principles, some\nideas that endure, that make you, you. And I think of core values, integrity, honesty, those aren\u2019t core values. Those are\nvalues that everyone should have. But there have to be like three, five, six things that are unique to you. And you can\nprobably think about this in your life. What is different about you, that every single other person, if you could only tell them\nthree or four things, you would want them to know about you. And we realized that when Zappos was one hundred\nemployees, they wrote down these ten core values. The thing I learned from Tony is I wish I didn\u2019t wait until I was one\nhundred employees to write down a core value. I was talking to Sam, he thinks we are the only company to write our core\nvalues down before we hired anyone.\nAlfred Lin: How long did it take you to hire your first employee?\nBrian Chesky: So the first employee was our first engineer, I think we looked for him for four or five months. I probably\nlooked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people.\nAlfred Lin: By then, when you hired him, when did you write it? Was it on day one or two or was it three?\nBrian Chesky: I think we started working on it around the time of Y Combinator, which would've been January 2009. It\nwas probably a process that evolved over the course of six to seven months. We finished Y Combinator in April 2009,\nhired our first engineer in July something like that. Probably six months. Some people ask why did you spend so much\ntime on hiring your first engineer. I think bringing in your first engineer is like bringing in a DNA chip to the company. This\nperson, if we're successful, there were going to be a thousand people just like him or her in that company, it still wasn't a\nmatter of getting somebody to build the next three features we need the ship for users. There was something much more\nlong-term and much more enduring which was, do I want to work with one hundred thousand more people like this? Now,\nyou want diversity to play, you want diversity of background, age. You don't want diversity of values, you want very\nhomogenous beliefs. That\u2019s the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be diverse.\nAlfred Lin: So what were these values?\nBrian Chesky: Six core values, I\u2019ll talk about maybe three of them. So the first core value we talk about is champion in\nmission. And what it really means is that we want to hire people that are here for a mission. We don\u2019t want people here\nbecause they think we have a great valuation, they like our office design, they need a job, or they think it\u2019s hot. We want\npeople to be here for the one thing that will never change, and that\u2019s our mission.

But in this summer on a typical night or a peak night, we\nwouldhave four hundred twenty five thousand people staying in homes and living together and they were coming from a\nhundred and ninety different countries in the world which is every country except North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba. So just\nhearing that story, at our core that is what we are about. That\u2019s much more than just booking a room or traveling. That\nwhat we are about is we want to help bring the world together. We want to do that by giving a sense of belonging\nanywhere you go. Our mission is to belong anywhere. So five years from now, twenty years from now, maybe we're still\nselling rooms and homes to meet in or not, but I can guarantee you we're always going be about a sense of belonging\nand bringing people together. And that's the more enduring idea.\nSo when we hire people, the first thing to make sure it is that, if that is your mission, you need to champion your mission.\nYou champion the mission by living the mission. Do you believe in it? Do you have stories about it? Do you use the\nproduct? Do you believe in the product? I used to ask crazy questions, one of the crazy questions Sam reminds me of, I\nuse to interview people. So I interviewed the first three hundred employees at Airbnb which people think I\u2019m really\nneurotic and they may also be true. I used to ask them a question, if you had a year left to live would you take this job? I\namended it, people who say yes probably don't like their families. So I changed it to ten years. I feel like you should use\nwhatever time you have left to live. Whatever you want to do in those last ten years you should just do. I really want you to\nthink about that, that was enough time for you to do something you really cared about and the answer doesn't have to be\nthis company. I say fine if what you\u2019re meant to do is travel or start a company just do that, don't come here. Go do that.\nSo there is this old parable about two men laying bricks. Somebody comes up to the first man and says what are you\ndoing? I\u2019m building a wall. He asks the other guy, he says I\u2019m building a Cathedral. There's a job and there is a calling.\nWe want to hire people not only looking for jobs, but a calling. And that's the first value, champion the mission.\nI don\u2019t want to take all the time, I will talk about just one more. The second value relates to being frugal and I will tell you a\nstory. By the way, all the founding stories of your company end up becoming the things that you keep talking about to\nthousands of people, kind of like a child, that these things keep coming back later in life. So Airbnb, I think Marc\nAndreessen said in the last talk that it was the worst idea that ever worked. I remember people thinking we were crazy, I\nremember telling people about the idea, I actually told Paul Graham, I said we have this idea it\u2019s called Airbnb. He asked,\npeople are actually doing this? I said, yeah. Question was, what's wrong with them? So I knew the interview wasn't going\nwell and in the interview Paul Graham I think wasn't going to accept us. And we told the story of how we funded the\ncompany and here's how it goes. We're introduced, Michael Seibel, who is a partner of Y Combinator, introduced me and\nJoe to like fifteen investors in the Valley, including some of the ones that have been here and all of them said no to the\ncompany. They could have bought ten percent of the company for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. They all said\nno, they thought it was crazy.

No one would ever stay in someone's home.\nSo we ended up funding the company with credit cards and you know those binders kids in school put baseball cards in?\nWe had to put them in those, we had to put them somewhere. That\u2019s how many credit cards we had and we were\ncompletely in debt. And in the fall of 2008, we provided housing for the Democratic and Republican National Convention.\nWe had this crazy idea because we weren't selling a lot of homes. In the year after we launched, we had a hundred\npeople a day visiting our website and two bookings, which is generally bad. It\u2019s like releasing a song and a year later\nthree people are listing to it a day. It\u2019s probably not going to be a very popular song. But I believed in it. Joe and Nate\nbelieved in it.\nSo we are completely in debt, right, and we get this idea. We are an air bed and breakfast providing housing for the\nDemocratic Republican National Convention. What if we made a breakfast cereal for like the Democratic National\nConvention? And we came up with this Obama themed cereal. And we called it Obama-O\u2019s, the breakfast of change.\nThen we came up with a Republican themed cereal for John McCain. We found out he was a Captain in the navy. So we\ncame up with\u2026 Captain-McCain\u2019s, a maverick in every bite.

We ended up sending them to press and eventually\nwithin a week it got on national television, national news. We made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal.\nIn 2008 we made five thousand dollars from our website and we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal. I\nremember my mom asking so are a you cereal company now. And that wasn't that bad part, the bad part was the honest\nanswer which was technically, yes. But the reason I tell that is our second core value is to be a cereal entrepreneur. I'm\nsorry for the cheesy pun. But be a cereal entrepreneur. We really mean, is that we believe constraints bring out the\ncreativity. When you raise eight hundred million dollars suddenly all that scrappiness, it's easy to lose that scrappiness.\nIt\u2019s easier for people to tell you I just need this fifty thousand dollar contract. I need this, I need that. When people are\ndesperate and not being a little bit frugal, not being creative, or tell me they can't do something, I'll just take a box of\ncereal and even the suggestion of Obama-O\u2019s is you need to be scrappy and frugal. So again a lot of the founding DNA\nof your company becomes these values, these principles. Everyone knows that if you don't give a crap you shouldn't be\nhere. And it doesn't mean you have to give a crap it just means you have to to be here. You also have to be creative to be\nan entrepreneur and super scrappy. And these are some of the values we learned.\nAlfred Lin: So you guys should start to think about questions when we open up to questions from the audience but I have\na few more questions to ask. So this all sounds nice, stories are great. The people here are a pretty skeptical group. It\u2019s a\nCS department class, probably left brain focused. This feels like a softie, right brain focus. How does having a strong\nculture help you make important, tough decisions?\nBrian Chesky: Well I think that having it so, here's the thing about culture. There are three things they never tell you about\nculture. First thing is they never tell you anything about culture. No one talks about culture and no one ever tells the need\nto have strong culture. So there's tons of articles about building a great product, there's tons of articles on growth and\nadaption, and a few things about culture. It\u2019s a mystical thing that's soft and fuzzy. That's the first problem. The second\nproblem is it is hard to measure. Things that are hard to measure often get discounted. These are two very hard things.\nThe third thing, the biggest problem, it doesn't pay off in the short term. If you wanted to start up a company and sell it in\none year, the one thing I would tell you to do is fuck up the culture. Just hire people quickly. Culture makes you hire really\nslowly, makes you deliberate about your decisions that in the near term can slow progress. Putting an investment into the\ncompany short term.\nFirst thing is the need to be very clear about what's unique to you that you stand for. Once you do that, you need to hire\npeople that believe in that. You need to make sure you hire and fire based on these values. One thing we do is constantly\nrepeat over and over again when we interview, we want to make sure they are world class and fit the culture. The first\nthing I used to ask people at the end of the interview, I would say if you can hire, this is a functional question, if you could\nhire anybody in the world, would you hire the person sitting across from you? If our vision is the best in the world, why\naren\u2019t we hiring the best in the world? Every single person is meant to hire a person better than the previous people. You\nare constantly raising the bar. Then we have separate people called core values interviewers who aren\u2019t in the function.\nSo it you are an engineer, the core values interviewers are never engineers because we don't want them to be biased\nand say well I know how good they are. And they interview just for values, to make sure that people care about the same\nthing. And we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn't feel right about them being with us long term.\nSo that's one of the things.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4196, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fe84f8a-fd1a-45aa-a766-802523135906": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fe84f8a-fd1a-45aa-a766-802523135906", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b3efb34-486b-4a75-93e3-d5e63de0bcd1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "ef4729c29341416cea08a6aacceb1a8e244f01c2eca4208e631e4ef237881e4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f7c060c-e69f-4704-9bdb-adb38e498a30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1db3c45b5190ff849fc7fe987c51606b9a41acd0de563e2c0af217d41d53cd33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56a197db-677a-4484-af4e-7345b0f31dbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54b0170632378bf077ee2ea248314af1892e6944f2020047d312e60fb10aa65c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4953ae799fe0bae74a1a0c7fc425d0fb98f034e7e62777c85e1fae29b1a73178", "text": "If our vision is the best in the world, why\naren\u2019t we hiring the best in the world?

And we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn't feel right about them being with us long term.\nSo that's one of the things.\nSome other examples of when we have had to make hard decisions: in mid-2011, we were mostly United States and we\nhad this internet clone funded by these guys called the Samwer brothers, anyone ever hear of them? They basically\nclone internet companies. They recently went public. They take American websites and clone them and then quickly try to\nsell them back to you. It\u2019s kind of like putting a gun to your head. So they had done this to Groupon, Groupon was the\nfastest growing site in the world ever. They stopped doing Groupon and started cloning us, and this is back when we had\nforty employees, we had raised seven million dollars. They cloned us and in thirty days they hired four hundred people.\nAnd they wanted to sell the company and if they couldn\u2019t, they were going to destroy us around the world.\nThe problem with Airbnb is if we are not everywhere around the world, a travel site not being in Europe is like your phone\nnot having email, it doesn't actually work. So we were kind of in trouble. We had this conversation, it was a pragmatic\ndecision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision. The pragmatic one probably said buy them\nbecause you can't risk losing international, so just guarantee you are going to get international.

The reason we ended up not buying them was I just didn't like the culture. I didn\u2019t want to bring in those four\nhundred people. I felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries. I didn't feel like they were doing it for the\nbeliefs, I thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly.\nI believed in a war, missionaries would outlast and endure mercenaries. I also felt like the best revenge against an\ninternet clone was just to make them run the company long term. You had the baby, now you've got to raise it. So that's\nwhat we ended up doing and that was a very controversial decision. A lot of people were telling me you should buy this\ncompany, we didn't and I think it worked out\nAlfred Lin: What percentage of revenue comes from Europe?\nBrian Chesky: More than fifty percent\nAlfred Lin: I think it worked out. Okay, anybody have any questions? I can keep going . No one? One statement we had at\nZappos is culture and brand were two sides of the same coin. Airbnb has a great culture and a great brand. Do you care\nto talk about branding, it\u2019s kind of a weak thing, it's a value we don't tend to focus on.\nBrian Chesky: I actually just said that to Sam. I think Silicon Valley is not historically really strong or we don't talk about\nculture and brand very much. They are two sides of the same coin. So culture, like the principles and the beliefs you have\ninside a company that you want people to be aligned with long term, whatever happens inside the company eventually\ncomes out, you can\u2019t hold it in. And brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with. So I\nthink having a clear mission and making sure that you know that mission and the mission comes through the company, is\nprobably the best thing you can do for both culture and values.\nAnd then the second thing you know is that your brand, the way people think about you and your company, is often\ndecided by your brand evangelists who are your employees. If you have a weak culture, we often think that companies\nthat hire employees, people that are deeply passionate, create companies that customers are really passion about.\nThose are companies with strong brands. And so Zappos had a really strong brand. A lot of companies, Google, that\ncared deeply about culture, they actually have a question, is this person Google? Which is meant to be like the catch all\nfor the digital culture. It was a very strong culture, Google has a unique, there's no such thing as a good or bad culture, it\u2019s\neither a strong or weak culture. And a good culture for someone else may not be a good culture for you.\nSo I think brand is incredibly important as well. Brand is really the connection of you with your customers and so if you\nhave an incredibly strong culture, the brand will come through. The final thing to say about brand is a lot of people that\ntalk about their brand talk about what they sell. So if you\u2019re Apple, one way of doing the same, we sell computers and the\nnew screens are larger and faster and they talk about bits and bytes.\nI remember Steve Jobs had this really important talk where he says the way to win, this is 1997, isn't to talk about bits and\nbytes. The way to win is talk about what we value, what our core values are, we believe passionate people can change\nthe world. And that was how they introduced a different campaign.

Go through TSA,\nstay in a typical hotel, sometimes you'll have some problems. We really wanted to make people feel special. This is some\nof the stuff we did in the early days, we did a lot of storytelling. I mean I've probably told the story of Airbnb ten thousand\ntimes and this is a something that is kind of related to culture. Someone asked me the other day, what\u2019s the job of the\nCEO? There are lots of things a CEO does, but what you mostly do is articulate the vision. To articulate a vision you have\nto develop a strategy and hire people that fit the culture. If you do those three things you basically have a company and\nthat company will hopefully be successful.\nIf you have the right vision, a good strategy, and the people to get there. And so what you end up doing is articulating the\nvision over and over. Whether it\u2019s recruiting, talking to investors, getting funding, doing PR interviews, speaking in a class\nroom. You are always reinforcing the values. You\u2019re doing it in an email to a customer. You just do it a thousand times, it\nchanges and gets better and better every time. So it kind of evolved.\nVery good question. How do we make sure the hosts are reinforcing the culture of Airbnb? So the answer to that is we do\na pretty good job, but not yet an amazing job at that. When we first founded Airbnb, I took the Craig Newmark school of\nthought, Craig is the founder of Craigslist: anyone should be able to use Airbnb. If you want to rent your place, you should\nbe able to. It turns out, many people believe in our values because we talked about them and believed them. But there\nwere people who rented on Airbnb, not because they believed in the values but instead because they realized they could\nmake a lot of money renting their home. And not everyone was a great culture fit. These people actually did cause us a lot\nof problems, so this was a lesson for me. I didn't think, it didn\u2019t occur to me in the early days that the hosts had to\ncompletely fit our values. We met them, we attract people like us. We realized hosts are like partners and they need to\nbelieve in the same culture we do. So now we have this program called the Super Host program where they have to\ndemonstrate values to reach this kind of badge which gets the priority customer support and distribution. We are having\nthis important host convention where we bring all the hosts in and will be talking about reinforcing our values. So the\nanswer is, we were really late, but we now do it by reinforcing it every step of the way.\nQ: Brian, Airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community. Do you have any thoughts on how\nthat contributes to your culture and company values?\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, I think just in general, it may be related to two things about Airbnb. We tend to be a pretty open\nculture just in general, we believe in a shared world where people are giving back, contributing to making communities\nand industries stronger. It\u2019s my philosophy to talk about everything internally, except for things that relate to customer or\nclient privacy, if it doesn\u2019t relate to those two things, then we will talk about it.\nAs far as open source culture and engineering, we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the\nteam and so we really felt like a lot of source code shouldn't be you know, we felt like every company needs some kind of\nmoat that protects you from your competition. We thought some technology would be, but we also felt like we wanted to\ngive back from a technology standpoint. We preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the\nworld when you use Airbnb, that has the biggest network effects. We thought that kind of took precedent over some of the\ntechnology that we use, so we decided to try to share some of that out to people. I think it does relate to the values, I never\nrecommended, I never one day recommended we do any of that. We hired engineers that we thought shared our values\nin culture and they felt that was the right thing to do.\nQ: You talk about conventions, what did you do when you had no money and you only got paid for those who used your\nsite.

The best advice I ever got was probably from Paul\nGraham. Paul Graham said, I remember he had this line, it's better to have a hundred people that love you than to have a\nmillion people that just sort of like you. It's literally better to have a hundred people love you. And the reason why, if you\nhave one million customers, one million users and they just kind of don't care about you but they use your app and think\nyou're okay, to get them to care is a really hard thing, I don\u2019t know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care. But I\ndo know if you get a hundred people who love you, those people, if they feel incredibly passionate, they will go out and\neacb tell a hundred people. All movements that lead to companies or ideas start with just a hundred people.", "start_char_idx": 3538, "end_char_idx": 5184, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "989b133b-dc56-41d0-9766-2bd2d1391e0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "989b133b-dc56-41d0-9766-2bd2d1391e0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35dd4938-5ec8-406b-89b5-41f1ea8d5ace", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2eb5e09c44d9a5641f09d270a2d4975ba1c62aa521f5ca1e85441e10cd29e28a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2ff5a49-c90b-4c43-bd66-cb7fac8f4f17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "dbca306a3336bf9a07cd05e808855329f4ecde4a96f49955e5bcdc7c1d194527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55eed77d-98e0-4b0b-8224-524b279cfa15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04fabbc7fde871ef837d5c7e9901f6b950e9f11163b6dfba870fda0cfa96397b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "35e7cca09ac33dc276794c47b43d4c2ad0842c441f42a26caec1c055dd841395", "text": "So the reason this is so critical, is he gave us another lesson which is that if all you need do is get a hundred people to\nlove you, is do things that don\u2019t scale. So it's hard if you've got a million people, you can't you meet them all. You can\nmeet a hundred people, you can spend time with them. So that's exactly what we did. Joe, Nate, and I would go door to\ndoor in New York City, or in Denver where the Democratic National Convention was, literally staying and living with our\nusers. It's a joke that when you buy an iPhone, Steve Jobs does not come sleep on your couch. But I will. That was really\ncritical, living with our users. All we had to do was get in with them and share a passion with our users. You work\nbackwards from a hundred people, even one person. But with our new technology, imagine what would be an amazing\nexperience for just this one person. Walk through the journey from that one person, make it perfect for that one person.\nOnce you make it perfect for one person, it's actually really easy to make a service easy for one person, it\u2019s not that hard.\nWhere everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time. So the first thing we did was went door to door,\nthat is one thing, that set up memories.\nI will give one more example before I stop talking about this. Right now with Airbnb you can click a button and put in your\nhome and a professional photographer comes to your home and photographs it for free. We have five thousand\nphotographers around the world and we have photographed hundreds of thousands of homes. So it is the probably one\nof the largest on-demand photography groups around. I believe this started with Joe and I, we were staying with this one\nhost, in New York City and her house is amazing but her photos were terrible. So we asked, why you don\u2019t put up better\nphotos? This is before the life of the great cameras, 2008. She couldn\u2019t figure out how to get photos from her phone onto\nher computer. She wasn\u2019t a very technically savvy woman. And I just said, we will just take photos for you. Actually, I said,\nwhat if you could press a button and somebody would show up at your door to take professional photographs? She said\nthat would be magic.\nSo the next day, I knock on her door going, I\u2019m here. I photographed her home. I sent a few emails to people saying we\ngive this new magical photography service and if you want, you can press the button for a professional photographer to\nshow up at your home. So they would hit this button and it would send me this alert. We rented a camera in Brooklyn. And\nin January 2009, walking through the snow, we photographed people\u2019s homes. We did this by hand without any\ntechnology. We managed that with spreadsheets. I wasn\u2019t going to bother Nate to design something for photography.\nThen we started hiring contract photographers. Eventfully we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers.\nThen we made a full time position to manage the other interns of the contract employees. And at some point, this is before\nwe built anything, at some point there were too many people to manage. There were like hundreds of photographers.\nThen we built all the tools to do all the photography. But we did it only after we knew what the perfect service was.\nQ: One more question, the question is, in this particular situation with Airbnb, a lot of people think it is not necessarily a\ntechnology company, but more of a marketing company.\nBrian Chesky: Good question. I will answer the question with a story.\nAlfred Lin: Let me preface that question with a series of questions. Do you today have propriety technology?\nBrian Chesky: Yes.\nAlfred Lin: Do you have a moat?\nBrian Chesky: Yes Alfred Lin: Do you have network effects?\nBrian Chesky: Yes.\nAlfred Lin: Do you have pricing power?\nBrian Chesky: Yes\nAlfred Lin: Do you have a good brand?\nBrian Chesky: I think so .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3878, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55eed77d-98e0-4b0b-8224-524b279cfa15": {"__data__": {"id_": "55eed77d-98e0-4b0b-8224-524b279cfa15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "548ef30d-a0a5-4957-b106-6e0c6da700c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d42336bb3fd2b334c7433a03f59e4175ef0546734b42f2b63dd806d416c01ffa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "989b133b-dc56-41d0-9766-2bd2d1391e0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "35e7cca09ac33dc276794c47b43d4c2ad0842c441f42a26caec1c055dd841395", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ce5e0ec-3932-4f55-94cf-f8f8f0941abf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c2e836fb7088c910bf21cbff3e02243ebddf59377f9ce1b3ac2f73c16463a6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "04fabbc7fde871ef837d5c7e9901f6b950e9f11163b6dfba870fda0cfa96397b", "text": "Alfred Lin: Are you a monopoly?\nBrian Chesky: I am not going to answer that one\nAlfred Lin: Getting back to the question, just forgetting about all of that, companies that have network effects and sort of\nget off the ground, the fly wheel is going, people just think you are lucky.\nBrian Chesky: Let me just answer that one. It\u2019s a totally fair question and people have said it so I want to answer it. The\nguy who owns Sequoia Capital, his name is Doug Leone. One day, I think it was a year, year and half ago, he says, Your\njob sucks. And I was all, What the hell does that mean? He says, You have the worst job of any CEO in my portfolio. I\nsaid, Tell me why.\nAnd this is what he said. \"First of all you are a technology company,\" and I would say that at our heart we are a\ntechnology company. \"So you have all the challenges of all the other portfolio companies. But beyond that, you are in a\nhundred and ninety different countries. So you have to figure out how to be international. You have to hire in every\ncountry in the world.\" We are literally in every country except North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Cuba. We are a payments\ncompany. We handle billions of dollars of transactions a year, we had to get a business license in the state of California.\nWe have serious fraud and risk. It needs to be locked down like Fort Knox. He said, \"That\u2019s usually where companies\nend. But you have to worry about all the other crap. Trust and safety.\"\nWe have four hundred and twenty five thousand people staying in other people's individual beds, in their sheets. Think\nabout a woman from Texas staying in the Middle East, or vice versa. Think about the cultural conflicts that could happen\nand misunderstandings. You have four hundred and twenty-five thousand people a night. It\u2019s like being the Mayor of\nOakland. So imagine you are the Mayor of Oakland and all the things that happened in Oakland tonight. You have trust\nand safety.\nNow we have regulatory problems. We are in thirty thousand different cities. Every city has different rules, different laws,\nand many were written in a different century. They were written before you had all the technology. Then you have issues\nlike search and discovery. Google has this thing about being really good at search. Google can give me all these results,\nbut it\u2019s clear that there is only one or two right answers for everybody. We have forty thousand homes in Paris. There is no\nbest home in Paris for anyone in this room. So we have to be really, really great at matching people and technology.\nAnother example, Facebook is a digital product. Their product is their website. Our product is these experiences that you\nhave in the real world. We are not just an online product, but also an offline product. So basically the long and the short of\nit is we have to be world class at technology, world class at design, we have to be world class at branding. We have to\nconvince government we are good for their neighborhood.

We have Ben Silbermann, the founder of Pinterest, and John and Patrick\nCollison, the founders of Stripe. Founders that have obviously, some of the best thinking about culture and building their\nteams.\nThere's three areas we are going to cover today. One will be general thoughts on culture as a follow up on the last\nlecture. And then we are really going to dig in to the findings of these companies and building out the early team. Then\nhow that changes and evolves as these guys have scaled their companies to the hundred plus, I don't even know how\nmany employees you have now but quite a lot, these very large organizations and how they adapt these principles of\nculture. But to start off, I just want to ask a very open ended question which is, what are the core pieces of culture that you\nfound to be the most important in building out your companies?\nBen Silbermann: Sure. What are the most important parts? For us, we think on a few dimensions. One is who we hire,\nwhat those people value. Two is what we do every day. Why do we do it? Three is what we choose to communicate and I\nthink four is how we choose to celebrate. Then the converse of this is what you choose to punish, but in general I think\nrunning a company based on what we celebrate is more exciting than what we punish. I think, the four things I think make\nup the bulk of it for us.\nJohn Collison: One thing, I think Stripe has placed a large emphasis on, more so than other companies, is transparency\ninternally. I think it's something that's been really valuable for Stripe, and a little bit misunderstood. All the things people\ntalk about, like hiring really great people or giving them a huge amount of leverage.\nTransparency for us plays into that. We think that if you are aligned on a high-level about what Stripe is doing, if everyone\nreally believes in the mission, that if everyone has really good access to information, and everyone has a good picture of\nthe current state of Stripe, then that gets you a huge amount on the way there in terms of working productively together.\nAnd it forgives a lot of the other things that tend to break as you grow a startup. So as we have grown, we started off two\npeople, we\u2019re now a hundred seventy people, we\u2019ve put a lot of thought into the tooling that goes around, transparency.\nBecause with a hundred and seventy people, there's so much information being produced that you can't just consume it\nall as a fire hose. And so, how we use email, things like that, we can go into it more later. But that's one of the core things\nthat helped us work well.\nPatrick Collison: I think culture, to some degree is a resolution to a bandwidth problem. In the sense that, when you start\nout working on something you are coding all the time, but you can't code all the things that you think the product may\nneed. And so the organization gets larger. Maybe in some idealized world, I don't actually think this is true, but ideally you\nshould be involved in every single decision, in every single type of moment of the company, everything that happens, but\nobviously you can't. Or maybe you can if you're two people, but you certainly can't if you're five or ten. At that time, it\ncomes very quickly, by a hundred and fifty, it's completely hopeless.\nAnd so culture is the invariant that you want to maintain, as you get specifically involved in fewer and fewer decisions\nover time. When you think about it that way, maybe intended importance becomes self-evident. Again, the fraction of\nthings you can be involved in directly, diminishing, exponentially, assuming your headcount growth is on a curve that\nlooks like one of the great companies. And yeah, that's super important. It manifests itself in a bunch of different ways. For\nexample, in hiring, maybe the reason the first ten people you hire, the decisions are so important that aren't just hiring\nthose first ten people, you are actually hiring a hundred people because you think each one of those people are going to\nbring along another ten people with them. And thinking exactly what ninety people that you would like those first ten\npeople to bring on. It's going to be quite consequential for your company but really briefly I think it's about abstraction.\nLecture 11: Company Culture and Building a Team, Part\nII\nPatrick Collison", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4346, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc7c3141-aeb4-4eea-948f-3f13b569b945": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc7c3141-aeb4-4eea-948f-3f13b569b945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f595db2-6fa4-4d90-bee1-5adb9007d114", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "26ff6f0403d8409365a3bcaeb5e11bcbddd2be25b33b3b0f38c0fb58d5963b12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ce5e0ec-3932-4f55-94cf-f8f8f0941abf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "6c2e836fb7088c910bf21cbff3e02243ebddf59377f9ce1b3ac2f73c16463a6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f7b935a-0a87-4a8c-b019-5493355439f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e99af9550dbf860bc714114b2a6254c1dae3d8df36a70f6c69218fb6154c820", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d964983d8ea5081aabd8bf6265343cb13fad3a1d5b7715a8d13803b04cb4ce54", "text": "Sam Altman: One thing a lot of speeches in this class have touched on is hiring those first ten employees. If you don't get\nthat right, the company basically never recovers. But no one has talked about how to do that, so what have you looked for\nwhen you have hired these initial employees to get the culture of the company right? How have you found them?\nBen Silbermann: I guess this answer is different for every company. I\u2019ll say for us it was very inductive. Clearly I looked for\npeople that I wanted to work with, and I thought were talented. I have read all these books on culture, because if I don't\nknow something, the first thing I do is go read about it. Everyone has all these frameworks, so I think one big\nmisconception that someone said once was, people think of culture as architecture when it is a lot more like gardening.\nYou plant some seeds, then you pull out weeds when it's not working, and they sort of expand. When we first hired\npeople, we hired people that were more like ourselves. I often looked for three to four things that I really valued in people.\nI looked for people who worked hard, had high integrity, low ego. I looked for people who were creative, super curious,\nwhich meant they had all these interests.\nSome of our first employees are some of the quirkiest you have ever met. They were engineers but they had all these\ncrazy hobbies. Like one guy made his own board game, with his own elaborate set of rules. Another guy was really into\nmagic tricks, and he not only coded a magic trick on an iPhone but he shot the production video in the preview. And I\nthink that quirkiness is a calling card that we find, the people that are excited about many disciplines and extraordinary at\nonce, tend to build really great products and are really great at collaborating.\nAnd the last thing, we really want someone who wants to build something great. And they aren't arrogant about it, they\nwant to take a risk and build something bigger than themselves. And that, in the beginning, is very easy to select for. If\nyou were in our position, we were in this horrible office, nobody got paid. There was no external reason to stay except\nwanting to build something to join. In fact there was every reason not to. And that's something, looking back, that I really\nvalue. Because you always knew people were joining for the purest of reasons and in fact forgoing other job\nopportunities, market salary, a clean office, good equipment just for the chance to work here. To this day, I think a lot of\nthose traits are seeded and embedded in the folks that we look at now.\nJohn Collison: The first ten hires is really hard, because you're making these first ten hires at a point where no one's\nheard of this company before. Nobody wants to work with you. You are these two weird people working on this weird\nidea-\nPatrick Collison: Their friends are telling them not to join. For our second employee, he either accepted the offer or was\njust about to, and his best friends took him out the night before, it was a full on assault, why you should not join this\ncompany. Why it is ruining your life basically. And the guy continued to join, actually one of those friends now works at\nStripe, but this is what you are up against.\nJohn Collison: And it's hard, no batch of ten people will have as big of an influence on the company as those first ten\npeople. And I think that everyone's impression of recruiting is you open LinkedIn and it's sort of like ordering off the dollar\nmenu, I want that one, that one, that one and now you have some hires. At least for us, it was over a very long time period\ntalking to people we knew, or friends of friends into joining. We didn't have huge networks, we were both still in college by\nthen. So there were really no people that we worked with to draw in. So a lot of those early Stripers were people we\nheard of from friends.\nThe other interesting thing they had in common, they were all really early in their career or undervalued in some way.\nThink about it, if someone is a known spectacular quantity, then they are probably working in a job and very happy about\nit.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4126, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f7b935a-0a87-4a8c-b019-5493355439f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f7b935a-0a87-4a8c-b019-5493355439f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f595db2-6fa4-4d90-bee1-5adb9007d114", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "26ff6f0403d8409365a3bcaeb5e11bcbddd2be25b33b3b0f38c0fb58d5963b12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc7c3141-aeb4-4eea-948f-3f13b569b945", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d964983d8ea5081aabd8bf6265343cb13fad3a1d5b7715a8d13803b04cb4ce54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95849feb-8edf-4c39-af04-26de36581c95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c87a71e60353d2673e9aa7ab4be81a3826abcac37aea7641b813a27a5bbdbc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1e99af9550dbf860bc714114b2a6254c1dae3d8df36a70f6c69218fb6154c820", "text": "And I think that everyone's impression of recruiting is you open LinkedIn and it's sort of like ordering off the dollar\nmenu, I want that one, that one, that one and now you have some hires.

So we had to try to find people who were, in the case of our designer that we hired, he was eighteen and in high school\nand in Sweden at the time. As the case with our CTO, he was in college at the time. A lot of these people, they were early\non in their careers, and the only way we could, you can relax one constraint, you can relax the fact that they are talented,\nor relax the fact that it's apparent that they are talented. And we, not consciously, we relaxed the latter.\nPatrick Collison: Finding the right people, you have to think like a value investor right, you're looking for the human capital\nthat's significantly valued by the market. You probably shouldn't look to hire your friends from Facebook, and Google, or\nwhatever, they are already discovered, and if they want to join you, that's great.

Generally speaking in culture I want to carry out everything we say, advice is very little\nadvice, wildly extrapolated and I think there is a lot of truth to that.\nFor our first ten people, the things that seemed to be important, they were also very genuine and straight. And I think that\nmatters quite a lot, there are people that others want to work with. That there are others that people trust, that they are\nintellectually honest on how they approach problems. They are generally people who like to get things finished. There\nare a lot of people who are really excited about tons of things. Only some of those are excited about completing things.\nThere is a lot of talk out there, like hiring people off their GitHub resumes, that doesn't really ring correct to me as there is\na large premium on lots of different things. I think it's much more a priori, much more interesting to work with someone\nwho took two years to spend time going deeper into an area. And then the third trait that we looked for is that they cared a\ngreat deal, it's offensive to them when something is just a little off.\nIn hindsight there were all these crazy things that we use to do that, do in fact, seem crazy. Like I should have not done\nthem. Everyone was always like, it was borderline insane how much they cared about tiny details like we used to. Every\nsingle API request that ever generated an error went to all of our inboxes and phoned all of us. Because it seemed\nterrible to get an error that didn't get a resolution from the users standpoint. Or we used to copy everyone else on\noutgoing email and point out slight grammar or spelling mistakes to each other. Because it would be horrible to ever send\nan email with a spelling mistake. Anyways, those are the three traits we came up with, genuine, caring a great deal, and\ncompleting things.\nBen Silbermann: I have something to say, I don't think there is a wrong place to find people. So when I look back at our\nfirst hires we hired, they came from all over the place. I put up ads on craigslist, I went to random Techtalks, we used to\nthrow weekly BBQ\u2019s at the office, bring your own food and drinks and then we would just talk to folks. I think every time I\nwent to get coffee at Philz, one of you guys were recruiting. Because your office was strategically placed next to the best\ncoffee shop. But I think the really good people, generally are doing something else so you have to go seek them out\ninstead of expecting that they are going to seek you out. Triple when no one has ever heard of or is using the product that\nyou work on.\nJohn Collison: Yeah and it's probably really important to have a great elevator pitch, not just for investors but because\neveryone that you run into right now is six months to a year down the road a recruit. So the right time to have gotten them\nexcited about your product, the right time for them to have started following us, is as soon as it can start. It's going to take\na very long time to recruit people, so getting people consistently excited about what you are doing will pay back later.\nPatrick Collison: Maybe this is a little tangential, but a bunch of our friends started companies right out of school. And we\nstarted thinking, what goes wrong in those companies? And I think the most common failure mode was doing something\noverly niche, overly specific or bad. I think there is a major shift in time horizon as you go from classes to a startup. A class\nplays out on a quarter, or a semester, where a startup is a five or ten year thing. And I think this is really problematic,\nbecause it's really quite hard to hire people for niche things. If you told someone, look we are going to build a rocket that\ngoes Mars, that sounds almost impossible but sounds fucking awesome. It's really easy to convince people to work on it.\nInstead of, well we are going to work on, I'm not going to give any specific idea, probably going to sound like we are\ndoing a startup.

So you meet people at these BBQ\u2019s, you are friends, maybe you have worked\nwith them. What did you guys do specifically to identify that this person was going to be really great? Or did you really get\nit wrong? When did you learn you could identify raw talent? Or say they work at Google, or Facebook so they must be\ngood.\nBen Silbermann: You will never 100% know until you work with folks. So the flip side is, if the person you hired is not a\ngood fit, you owe it to them and to the company to tell them where to improve and if they aren't working out, then to fire\nthem. But I think, generally, the question of talent falls into two big buckets. One is, you have some sense of what makes\nthem good at their job. And there are some areas where you can test that area. And there are some that you don't. And\nthe ones where you don't are much more difficult.

And this comes in a little\nlater when you are hiring the head of finance and you know nothing about finance, except what is contained in a library\nbook that you got. Like an introduction to finance or marketing. So I always made it a habit of mine to talk to people I knew\nde facto were world class and just asking them, what are the traits you look for? What are the questions you ask? And\nhow to find them? If you are looking for the next person that is as good as you, where is that person working right now\nand what's her phone number? I think that learning what's good and bad during the interview process is extremely\nexpensive. It is an expensive use of your time, expensive use of everyone else's time. A recalibration of that really\nmatters.\nThen once you have someone in an interview process, you will build the process over time to screen quality. Pinterest,\nwe have an evolving set of questions that are rotating through and we are always asking if these are good indicators or\nbad indicators of quality. The other thing the questions are supposed to do is give us a sense of, is this the right place for\nthis person to come in and work? This is the point you guys made about being very transparent. About what's going to be\neasy or hard. Really great people want to do things that are going to be hard. They want to solve tough problems, so\nthere was a sense of brilliance in Google sending out these interview questions that were thought to be really difficult.\nThen people who like solving problems, they come out and seek those. I think it's really important as companies get\nbigger that they don't whitewash the risks. I heard that Paypal, you go in and after the interview they say, by the way,\nMastercard wants to kill us and you will be doing something that is illegal, but if you succeed you will redefine payments.\nOr when they were recruiting for iPhone, they didn't even tell people what they were doing. You won't see your families\nfor three years, but when you are done, your kids, your kids' kids will remember what you built. I think that's a really good\nthing in recruiting as well. Be very very transparent on why you think it's a great idea, but you lay out in gory detail why it's\ngoing to be hard. And then the right people select in or they select out of that opportunity.\nPatrick Collison: Evidence suggests they were able to see their kids though.\nJohn Collison: I think one thing you have to do when identifying talent is have the confidence to interview in a way that\nworks for you. I think, say you are not the world's best engineer and you are trying to interview engineering candidates. I\nthinks it's tempting to co-opt what everyone else does, get them to put things on a whiteboard and do other engineering\nthings. In the case of Stripe, we flew a guy out and we spent a weekend coding with him and looking over his shoulder. It\nwas the only way we could tell and get ourselves confident if that guy was any good. And I think you can extend that to\nany roles you are not an expert in. In that I am no business development guru but when we hire for business\ndevelopment roles, we have a project that we have them talk about, how they would improve an existing project that\nStripe has or which new projects they would go out and do. And even if it is not my domain area, I am confident enough I\ncan judge those really well. I think people often have this imposter syndrome when it comes to interviewing for roles.\nPatrick Collison: I think a specific tactical thing to do, again, for the first ten people is to work with them as much as you\ncan before committing to hire them. Once you hit a certain scale it's kind of impractical to put them on that side and be\nunskilled. Expensive from your side. But it's really worth it to the first ten people, right. In the majority, the first ten people,\nwe worked with them to some capacity for a week in advance. It's pretty hard to fake it for a week, it tends to be quite clear\nquickly.

I think the slightly more intuitive decision is,\nis this person the best out of all of their friends at what they do? It's a little insensitive on how they choose among friends,\nbut for me at least I find that a better way to think about it is, is this the best engineer this engineer knows? And the other\nthing worth mentioning is, on the first ten people on the culture and team topic, I think everyone doesn't realize until they\ngo through it themselves, how important it is because in life and media people focus too much on founders. Here we are\nand we are reinforcing the structural narrative that Stripe is about John and Patrick and Pinterest is about Ben.

Asking\npeople with experience for their honest opinion. We do that really aggressively but we are trying to figure out what this\nperson is like to work with. We are trying not to validate if they told the truth on their resumes because we assume they\ntold the truth. So a very standard question is in an interview I might say, hey we both know Jonathan, because we are\nboth friends, if I asked him what you are best at, what you are the most proud of, or what you were working to improve,\nwhat would he or she say? Because it creates social awareness and accountability. Then I typically ask something that\nmakes the question, that is typically soft, feel a little bit more quantitative and then calibrate that over time. To evaluate\nthis person's dimensions, is this person the top 1% of the people you worked with, the top 5%, and the top 10%? And it\nforces scarcity that gives them material reference. Instead of saying, hey what's the best thing about John? You say, he\ntold me he was good at these things. Can you validate it? Yeah, sure. It's the type of tool that should be taken seriously.\nJohn Collison: And referencing, obviously, isn't easy to begin with. But it does provide really useful over time. And I think\nfor name references people do want to be nice so you have to create an artificial scarcity by saying, where would you\nrank this person with people you worked with. You should aim to spend fifteen minutes on the phone with that person\ninstead of letting them say, yeah this person is awesome.\nSam Altman: Also those references are a tremendous source of recruits. Once you hire these first people and they join,\nwhat have you done to make them effective quickly and to get them to the right culture place? Hiring is usually difficult but\nthen not as difficult as making them happy and effective. So what do you do with these early employees to accomplish\nthat?\nBen Silbermann: Well the answer to that has changed since we went from small to bigger. When we first started it was\nbecause we needed that person, a long time ago. So their whole onboarding was, here's your computer, we already set\nup your environment, don't worry about it, this is the problem we have to solve together. That's the nature of the startups,\nwe were all in this tiny two bedroom apartment. All the other things, building personal relationships, spending time\ntogether, it all happened magically. You didn't have to do anything.\nThe one thing I would like to add to that is we always reminded people where we want to go with that someday. Because\nit's really easy to drop someone into a problem and they would think the whole world was this little problem in front of\nthem. We would always say, someday we want to do for Google what they did for search. Our plan for trying to get that\ndone.\nNow as the company grows, I think that problem has to get a little more formalized. So we spend a lot of time thinking and\nconstantly trying to refine what that person looked like from the day they came in, to their first interview, through 30 days\nafter they joined. Do they have someone's name they know? Do they know who their manager is? Have they sat down\npeople on their team? Do they know what the general arch of the company is? And what the top priorities are? And we\nhave a program we do. It's a week long and they have functions to go in deeper. And that's something that has always\nbeen refined. And the output metrics on that is one, we ask people, what did you think afterwards, then 30 days\nafterwards? Then we also ask their peers and manager, hey is this person up to speed? Do you feel we did a good job at\nmaking them productive? If we haven't then thats a key that a) we should not be hiring any more people because we're\nnot doing a good job bringing in new people and b) we need to retool that.\nI think those things are important.

And so when we have engineers start, we try to get them committing on the first\nday. When we have people in business roles start, we will have them in real meetings the first day on what they are\nmeant to be working on. Sometimes it's easy to be tentative and ease people in. We are much more, push people off the\ncliff. Then second, we try to quickly give people feedback. Expectedly giving people feedback on how to adapt to the\nculture.

One thing we have at Stripe is the culture is a\nlot more written. So you have people next to each other, with headphones on, IMing each other. And for a lot of people\ncoming in and working in an environment like that it's sort of hard-\nPatrick Collison: In from normal places.\nJohn Collison: Exactly yeah. So from everything high level of how you are doing at your job to minor cultural issues, the\nmore feedback you give them, the better they will do. Its unnatural to be telling people if they are doing a good or bad job.\nYou don't do that in your normal life, hopefully you are restrained. But when you have employees that is what you owe\nthem to do well.\nSam Altman: So I think this is a good transition to when you're companies have scaled. What are the biggest changes you\nhave had to make to your hiring policies and to how you manage the teams as you have gone from two to ten to a\nthousand employees?\nBen Silbermann: There are a lot of changes. I think one thing we try to do on the team side is to make the teams feel as\nautonomous and nimble as possible within the constraints of the organization. That means over time we are trying to\nmake it feel like a startup of many startups. Rather than this model setup with form policies cut horizontally through it. It's\neasier said than done, I don't think we are all the way there but one goal is that each team has control, to hold the\nresources that they need to get the goal done. They know what the most important thing is and how it's measured. That\nway the management problem because somewhat tractable. Otherwise it feels completely impossible if you can't\ndecompose it into atomic components. You just look at it like, Oh my gosh, complexity level is rising geometrically, on a\nmanagement level, it's never going to work.\nYou have to create these abstracted units. At least that's what we are going to try to do. Pinterest in particular, the real\nchallenge with building those abstract units is, we want units that encompass a super strong designer, or a super strong\nlead engineering, a writer, often times a community leader. We want them to be self contained. That kind of makes it hard,\nbut that kind of core is to our philosophy to build products. We put people together that have all these kind of disciplines,\nlots of things then we anchor them to a certain project then we try to remove barriers to let them go fast. Then we find no\nbarriers and we sit down to figure out how we speed that up. I think hiring is a little different. I think the biggest change\nand the biggest asset you get is the people, referrals become more and more the life blood depending on the network of\nthe people you bring in. So one of the lucky and in hindsight decisions we made was our actual fourteenth or fifteenth\nperson we hired was a professional recruiter. She worked at startups, she worked at big companies like Apple. But she\nsort of knew where that pipeline breaks down. Knew the early indicators, and taught everyone not just how to screen for\ntalent but to identify the people who are going to be culturally really good for the company. And I think looking back on\nthat, its something I personally really value.\nPatrick Collison: There is a huge amount of stuff here that is under management growth. Either your company fails really\nquickly or all of your problems become about management growth. One thing that tends to take people by surprise, and\ntook me by surprise, is how quickly the time horizons change. In your first month, you are largely thinking about things\none month ahead, right? Maybe that is what your development road map is oriented around. Who you are working with,\nmaybe it's a very informal relationships where they haven't fully committed to be full time or not. The more time that goes\nby, I feel that has a reciprocal in the time horizons.\nIn one year, you are thinking a year ahead. After four years you are thinking four years ahead.

But after two or three years, then it\nbecomes much more reasonable to make those investments.\nActually if you are not making those investments you are probably being much too short term.

How do you make it systematic, and effective at scale? It's all going to vary significantly, in perfect\nproximation of what you would ideally do small, what hacks can you pull? Make it work as well as you possibly can at a\nlarge scale. A rapidly growing company, with head count here two-three heads a year, it's a very unnatural thing. What's\nthe least bad way of managing that growth? I think it's worth being systematic about it, thinking of ways to do it. Realizing\nyou can't do much better than ask a question. For Stripe, it's things like, we have three meals a day at long tables where\neveryone can sit together, if you think about how much more human interaction happens with having these randomly\nmixed meals. It's vast, right? A whole list of things like that. I think that's the general framework.\nBen Silbermann: One thing I'm really curious about. You guys value transparency. Have you scaled it over time? I know\nwith us, we think about it all the time. Just curious.\nPatrick Collison: Startups, I can't remember who defined it as, a startup is an organization that is not yet stuck with all\nthese principal agent problems. That large companies, what is locally optimal for you frequently is not what is globally\noptimal for the company. As a consequence of that, a reason a startup can just work differently than a big company, at a\nbig company, a lot of the things that are good for you, you couldn't do them in a completely transparent environment\nbecause people would think less of you. But because everyone is rolling in the same direction, a startup, you can kind of\nmake all the information transparent. Like I said earlier, Stripe used to bcc us to be on every email unless you opted out of\nit. We thought that would be more efficient, you wouldn't need to have as many meetings if you could keep abreast of\nwhat is happening. And over time, we sort of built an interesting framework of mailing lists. We now have a program for\ngenerating gmail filters. For a rocky path of fifty people or so to Ben's point of asking people how they are getting along\nafter several days. They all reported terrible because they couldn't find all the emails people were sending to them. They\nwere missing things and everything.\nJohn Collison: Gmail broke at one stage.\nPatrick Collison: Right, right. At one point Gmail broke because we were sending too much email. It is hard to scale\nbecause you might contact somebody out of the company with some great idea. The person sitting across the way from\nyou thinks it's the stupidest thing they have ever heard. You are kind of under that scrutiny of the whole organization in\nsome degree with all your communication. That's the challenging side, that people more formally know what's happening.\nI don't feel I can give a stronger endorsement of it than it has worked so far. I really am curious how it will work when we\nare five thousand people, if we are ever at that scale.\nJohn Collison: I think a couple things that helped us scale it, is we changed tools in changing the culture around it. On the\ntools front it use to be the case you could keep abreast of what's happening in the company by reading all the email. Now\nwe weekly all hands on deck. We actually have to put all this work into communicating what is going on in this company.\nSince there is so much more. The second is, cultural side so much information in terms. You have to create social norms\naround it. Obvious things such as what is confidential to Stripe. Less obvious things, like when emailing someone or\ntalking in Slack or IRC that is now viewed by one hundred seventy people, it's pretty easy to get stage fright. And it's pretty\neasy with what you thought was a reasonable proposal, you get this drive by criticism and you are less likely to share in\nthe future. We have had to create norms around when it is okay to jump into discussions and how that interaction works\nbecause people are around the stage much more.\nPatrick Collison: I'm sure it's not good to put anyone on the spot, but Emily interned at Stripe this summer.

The first week having\ntwo thousand emails in my inbox, then by the end there are three or four teams you want that information coming up from.\nSam Altman: So this question is for Patrick and John. Have the people that you hired early been able to grow up into\nleadership roles?\nJohn Collison: In Stripe's case yes. A lot of the first ten people are in leadership roles now. I think that's one thing that\ncorporations, it's an unnatural skill that they need to get good at. People don't exactly come out of the womb being good\nat management or at leadership. And being able to develop that in people and helping people progress as they spend a\nnumber of years at the company, it's a lot of work when people are running around with their hair on fire. But it's also\ndamaging if the company can't develop that skill.\nBen Silbermann: I think for us the answer is some yes and some no. I think one of the benefits of working at a startup is\nyou can be handed a challenge no one else would be crazy enough to let you take on. And that could be managing\npeople, it could be taking on a project. And also if you ask someone to take a risk like that, it shouldn't be one way\nthrough the door if you don't succeed. Otherwise it creates fear to give it a shot. So we have some folks managing a large\nteam at the start, individual programmers, individual engineers. And they say, Hey I would love to try leading a project,\nleading a group, then taking responsibility for management. Then we have other folks that try it and are really glad they\ndid so they know they never want to do that again. We try that, for those people, you can have just as much impact on the\ncompany through your individual contributions as an engineer or what have you. But it's really hard to predict unless you\ngive people a shot. So my strong preference is you give as many people a shot as possible. And in the few areas where\nyou feel there is too much of a learning curve relative to the business development you are trying to achieve, that is when\nyou look for someone who might walk in and really execute well on the job.\nSo the question was, has the vision changed since we initially started? Well I think on the vision, when we first started\nhiring, we were like we are going to build this really cool tool, people are going to enjoy it. I like collecting things, maybe\nothers like collecting things. And what we didn't expect that revealed itself early on, was that looking at other peoples\ncollections was, it turned out to be this really amazing way of discovering things you didn't know you were looking for. It\nbecomes a solution to the problem that a lot of other technologies don't have.\nOver the last year we have poured a lot of resources into building our recommendation products, search products, feed\nproducts. Leveraging the unique data that we have, which are these pins that were all picked by someone and hand\ncategorized. And the on the audience side, I think the first big surprise was truthfully when we first started, we didn't know\nif anyone would really use it. eE were just happy that anybody who wasn't related to us or obligated would use it. The\nbiggest surprise has been the diversity of people and how diverse those groups have been. And I think that's been one of\nthe things that's the most exciting. And the funny thing is, often as the company goes further along your aspirations get\nbigger. There is this gap that exists, and I tell my team, between where we are and we should be. Objectively we are\nfurther along, I feel the gap has widened. But I think that's a really common trait among people who found companies.\nSam Altman: So the question is, most start ups are not the iPhone. You can't guarantee that most people's grandchildren\nare going to remember this because most startups fail. How do you convince people to make sacrifices to do join a\nstartup?\nPatrick Collison: I think part of why it resonates with people is because it's not guaranteed.

If they list seven companies that have nothing to do with each other,\nexcept they are at the same stage, I love the stage of discovery, so I'm interviewing at Stripe, Jawbone, Airbnb, Uber, I'm\nalso putting my resume into Google X, that's a sign they are probably not being authentic, which you care about. And\nthose folks, when things get hard, they won't stick it out and work through it, because they were really signing up for an\nexperience, not for achieving a goal.\nPatrick Collison: I think the other thing that motivates people a great deal is the prospect of affecting some outcome, is just\nthe personal development angle. And a startup because it's more lightly staffed it's much less forgiving. Whether or not\nyou are the best or the worst person in the world, you are probably not going to alter Google's trajectory. Whereas if you\nreally want to benchmark yourself and see how much of a contribution and impact you can make, the startup is a much\nbetter place to test that.\nSam Altman: How does your user base affect your hiring strategy?\nBen Silbermann: Conventional base, you only hire people who use your product religiously everyday. And that probably\nworks well if you make an API. For us, we screen for people who have vision and discovery online. And they have to\nknow how our service works, and they have to have used it. But they may not be a lifelong user. And for us that's great,\nwe can ask what is the barrier that is preventing you from using it? Come join, we will move that barrier. Help us get\ncloser to that vision. If you read a startup book, there is all this wisdom, but it is only useful if it works in your certain\ncircumstance. So for us, we have had to broaden the lens a little bit and bring in people who are excited about the\nmission, that care about our product and our approach to building products. Even if from day one they weren't our earliest\nusers.\nJohn Collison: The one thing I want to tack onto this is, we touched on it being hard to hire early on for those first\nemployees, you have people with other options, you are very much at the ugly duckling stage. Hiring people who are\npassionate about your product is a great way to find people. You have a natural advantage over other companies. I know\nin Stripe's case, we hired four Stripe users, people who we probably couldn't have gotten otherwise. I'm sure it was the\nsame in Pinterest's case where you will get all this benefit at working with Pinterest, like, Hey it's Pinterest.\nSam Altman: Thank you guys very much for coming in today.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d828c45b-12b3-4ba3-8921-8e20d7843e39": {"__data__": {"id_": "d828c45b-12b3-4ba3-8921-8e20d7843e39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "519998cf-76b3-4de1-b6f3-2a2bb647c45a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "568993e6da431d280087d45d533d6e4e3b96913c0e96db02d0bcbf99fa715822", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bc514c2-a529-4f16-b540-00e52cc80281", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "46a27e5efda62b34744be0e68bf711240a5d933805adb5f45ef8f27e097615da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "75a1c464-9238-46d1-927f-8b0526a01ead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f2e7618c276ce4de8ede96562f0b45b393fe443d535ccf52e74baabb950342e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "10d71c11e3460049471b031f56925efae40c350aee6bd1e5cd37e8eca53a0c2c", "text": "Can we keep playing, yeah.\n[Eye of the Tiger starts]\nCan we turn it up a little bit so it has more pump up? Okay, there we go. Okay. Guys, we have to find the beat then clap to\nthe beat. Okay, please stop the music. Please put on the presentation. Thank you. That will be about the most pumped up\nthing that happens in enterprise software. The rest is downhill from here. Thank you for that well rehearsed intro.\nI\u2019m Aaron Levie, CEO and co-founder of Box. Welcome to this edition on how to build an enterprise software company.\nThis is my understanding, this is the course you are taking? Is that correct? No.\nSo this is my job today. I am going to try and convince you that everyone else that speaks during this whole class is\nwrong and that you actually want to build an enterprise software company. Hopefully we will be able to work through this\nand you'll have a good sense of why it's super cool to be in enterprise. And why the perceptions of going into the\nconsumer space, why it's so much fun are wrong, and why you want to go into enterprise software. Who wants to build an\nenterprise software company? Good, alright. Thank you very much. Hopefully we will do a vote at the end and hopefully\nthat will not have shrunk. That's really the only goal I have today.\nSo we are going to talk about three things today. The first is the quick background of Box. Because when we first started\nout, we did not know we wanted to do enterprise software. So I want to go a little bit into why we went after enterprise and\nwhat we do today. Then we are going to talk the major factors that changed in enterprise software that make it possible to\ndo a startup today. And finally we are going to look at patterns that are ways to recognize and go build a startup by\nyourself. Hopefully, that will be some practical, useful advice. Just as a forewarning, my voice, I've been speaking a lot the\npast few days. So hopefully I will be able to get to that third part of advice and make it.\nBuilding for the enterprise, these are high level stats of Box. We have about two hundred forty thousand businesses that\nuse Box, there are over twenty-seven million users that have brought Box into their organization, and ninety-nine percent\nof Fortune 500s. Actually that one percent is really Microsoft and they don't seem to want to buy from us. We have to work\non that a little bit. A lot of users to bring Box into workplace environments, these are some of the organizations that are\nusing the product. We have a very wide range of industries from manufacturing consumer products to companies like\nGeneral Electric. Stanford Health Care actually uses the product for collaboration inside the medical department search.\nBetween health care, media, manufacturing, these are some of the range of industries we serve.\nSo the question is, how did we get here? Because we didn't start the company to be an enterprise software company\neven though that is how things ended up happening. We launched the company in 2005, we got the idea back in college\nwhich was 2004. Was anybody using the internet back in 2004? Okay great. I didn't know if millennials used the internet\nor not, so great. Sorry, okay no more age jokes. Okay here is the point. So back in 2004, you might remember there\nwasn't a lot to do back then. It was boring right? This was before Facebook, this is certainly before Snapchat, so before\nmuch to do. You couldn't send people fifteen second messages or photos that disappeared because you didn't even\nhave phones. So on the internet, in 2004, there wasn't a lot going on. This is sort of what the internet looked like, a barren\ndeserted landscape. Just to clarify, the happy camel is Google, the sad camel is Yahoo! This is the internet in 2004.\nYahoo! has done a lot better since then, but back in the mid 2004, they were trying to find their way. And Google was\ntaking over the world. But this was the extent of the entire world.\nSo what we noticed in 2004, in college, was for some reason it was really hard to share files. And as simple of an idea as\nthat is now, and you go back ten years. It was either really expensive or really hard to move data around through\ncorporate companies. I had an internship at the time, most of my job using data was to copy printed out papers and put\nLecture 12: Sales and Marketing\nAaron", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4321, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75a1c464-9238-46d1-927f-8b0526a01ead": {"__data__": {"id_": "75a1c464-9238-46d1-927f-8b0526a01ead", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d626435c-6f6f-4e8e-a95b-2f75ba44f9d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "aec380566305f8282970db1a9a24247f286217a6cf707c2c82c21c483b10689d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d828c45b-12b3-4ba3-8921-8e20d7843e39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "10d71c11e3460049471b031f56925efae40c350aee6bd1e5cd37e8eca53a0c2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d8852e6-dfc8-4dba-ad40-4b8dd1547f40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9be30042b31e21272cb395e4def33fd2a961c25e5dc94afa6434a89e88d0f9c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8f2e7618c276ce4de8ede96562f0b45b393fe443d535ccf52e74baabb950342e", "text": "them in cabinets. That's what you do as an intern if you are not a computer science guy. So I was really really good at\ncopying paper, unfortunately not a skill really used today. But it was really hard to share files. In classroom environments,\nyou were working in large groups, it was also hard to share files. I went to USC, and USC gave you fifty megabytes of\nstorage space. Fifty megabytes, you can basically store one file. Then it would auto delete every six months. So whoever\nwas running IT at the time, they certainly weren't running hard drives. And so it was really, really hard to store and share\nfiles. Well, why don't we make it easy to store and share files from anywhere?\nSo we got the idea for, at the time, Box.net. And what we noticed was, there were a lot of factors that changed in the\nsoftware world. The first was the cost of storage was dropping dramatically. So in our business, basically every year or\ntwo you could double the amount of storage and data goes into a hard drive. So what was uneconomical now because\nfeasible. The cost of computing, the cost of storage has dropped. We had more powerful browsers, and networks. Firefox\nwas just emerging. People were using the much faster internet for homes and the classroom. Then people had more\nlocations that they wanted to store and share information with. So we had these three factors that were sort of emerging.\nSo pull these factors back when I give some tactical advice. The first point to remember, always look for the changing\ntechnology factors. Every market that has a significant change in underlying were enabling factors was in an environment\nthat was about to change in a very significant way. We were very fortunate in the need for data in the Cloud, was growing\nin importance. The cost and feasibility. was also not improving rapidly. We decided to put together this really quick\nversion of Box and launched it as Box.net. The idea was, let's make it really easy to share files. It turned out the idea\nclicked. We got angel funding from this guy named Mark Cuban. This was before Shark Tank but it was very similar. So\nwe got this funding and thought this was going to be super exciting.\nWe are going to drop out of college, we are going to move to the Bay area, and it's going to be awesome. And when you\ndrop out of college, anybody drop out of college yet? Okay, good. Stay in school! When you drop out of college, everyone\npictures it like it's going to be incredible. Bill Gates dropped out of college, it will be like Bill Gates. Or Michael Dell\ndropped out of college, it will be super exciting like Michael Dell. Steve Jobs dropped out of college, so this is what\npeople imagine, but nobody ever remembers that this guy dropped out of college also.\nSo it's not really a guarantee that it's going to be successful. It's funny, I don't even know if this guy dropped out of college.\nIt just seems like he had to. And I apologize if anyone is related to him, it's just a funny picture on the internet. So basically\nwe decided we would drop out of college, we moved up to first Berkeley, then Palo Alto. We decided we were going to\nopen up the product for free. We got hundreds of thousands of people to sign up for the product every single month. If you\ngo to Box.net you get one free gigabyte of file storage space. Which once again was big back in 2006. But we were\ngetting so many users, we were trying to figure out what to do.\nWhat we ran into was a common problem that, really, any startup runs into. Really pronounced by our business model\nwhich was, for consumers we built a very robust, very reliable enterprise. We really brought a really insignificant product.\nSo for consumers, what we were running into was we had all these features you could pay for but a lot of consumers\ndidn't need all those features. And for enterprises, we really didn't have enough securities and we didn't have enough\ncapabilities around how enterprises want to use their data. So we had more than what a consumer needed and not\nenough that an enterprise needed. So we found ourselves at the juncture. We found ourselves basically in this period\nwhere its very difficult to figure out what we wanted to do with the business.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4211, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d8852e6-dfc8-4dba-ad40-4b8dd1547f40": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d8852e6-dfc8-4dba-ad40-4b8dd1547f40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d626435c-6f6f-4e8e-a95b-2f75ba44f9d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "aec380566305f8282970db1a9a24247f286217a6cf707c2c82c21c483b10689d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "75a1c464-9238-46d1-927f-8b0526a01ead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "8f2e7618c276ce4de8ede96562f0b45b393fe443d535ccf52e74baabb950342e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29929678-d71b-4fda-9300-0aad071919cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1292e7082ddc8245a5773a720ecfb4e2c28b1a6fd0cce58adab87ca6168de5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9be30042b31e21272cb395e4def33fd2a961c25e5dc94afa6434a89e88d0f9c0", "text": "Which once again was big back in 2006.

We were at\nthis path, where we had to choose which path to go down.\nThis is back in early, mid 2006 up to late 2006. I was 23 at the time, my cofounder was 22. Our founding team was even\nyounger, we had all dropped out of college. So in 2006, 2007, we imagined these two paths and the worlds were very\nvery different. When you do a consumer startup it's basically lots of fun. You have parties all the time, it's just super\nexciting. Then in the enterprise you are battling these large, it's a rather thankless model because people just generally\nhate enterprise software. So that was sort of how we imagined the two paths, was we had to choose one of these two\nworlds. So we looked at that and thought. Okay consumer looks really fun, enterprise looks really hard and there is a lot\nof competition. At the same time, in this consumer space you are always fighting this issue of how do you monetize? How\ndo you actually get people to pay for product? In the consumer space there are really only two business models that you\ncan do.\nYou can either have people pay for your application or you could provide advertising on the application.

In the consumer world there are about thirty-five billion spent on\nmobile apps every year. Pretty big number right? Thirty-five billion dollars. That's a lot of money being spent on mobile\napps today. For advertising, the global digital advertising is $135 billion dollars. So most consumer businesses are going\nafter, if you are not doing e-commerce, are going after about $170 billion dollars of either purchasing power on\napplications or global advertising around these types of services. So big number, a lot of opportunity there.\nHowever, in the enterprise there are $3.7 trillion on enterprise IT every single year. These are the servers, the\ninfrastructure, the software, the networking, the services. All of that stack of technology equates to a few trillion spent\nevery year. What we realized was there was a rather wide delta between these two markets. We are going to be fighting\nto get consumers to pay a few dollars a month. And Google, Microsoft, and Apple will try to make this product free over\ntime. And there were rumors that google drive was coming out. And all these products that were going to happen, are\ncoming out. But in enterprise, its not about them trying to save money on IT.They are either trying to increase productivity,\nthey are trying to increase business. So the value equation is very different. So the consumer, we have limited amount of\nmoney that we wish to conserve for as few things as possible that we are going to spend. On the enterprise it's a little bit\nof a shift, actually what can I get out of technology? How much value is that for me? So that was a really important data\npoint.\nHowever, the problem was that enterprise software was very unsexy right? Very competitive, very hard to build a\nbusiness. It wasn't something you shot out of bed in the morning saying, I'm super excited to build an enterprise software\ncompany. And the reason for that was actually very straight forward at the time. The way that you built software was very\nslow. It was very slow because you couldn't break anything for customers, the sales process was very slow because\ncustomers take a long time to purchase technology. So I think everyone is used to this philosophy that when you are\ntrying to sell enterprise software, it could take up to years for them to actually just buy the software. Then it could take\neven more years for them to implement the technology in the first place. So a lot of companies are around for years\nwithout their technology even used in the first place.\nThat felt like a huge problem, and not something that we wanted to be a part of. The technology itself is complex, I don't\nknow how many people have had to use enterprise software but it's generally really complicated. You try to figure out,\nwhy in God\u2019s creation did a designer try to put forty-seven buttons on one page. You just can't even understand it and the\nreason is something we will get into in a second. But basically there is just no love or care for the design or user service.\nThe software is just complex. And finally, if that wasn't bad enough, you have to figure out how you are going to sell this\nsoftware. For anyone who loves the power of the internet, this notion of having a sales intermediary to get to your\ncustomer, seemed really unappealing. You have to hire a bunch of people, who are going to be in every country, they are\ngoing to be the only interface you have to your customer. You hire this guy named Chuck, and Chuck is going to roll in\nwith a brief case and he is going to try to sell lots of enterprise software to the customer. Just so we are clear, this is what\nChuck looks like. And that was the sale process that you, in the enterprise at least, that we imagined in our head. Chuck\nlooks like a happy guy, but he is still an intermediary to getting your software.

And to be fair they were\nright on several areas. We were a very inexperienced team. We were still very early in our careers. Our co-founder, for\ninstance, looked like he was 13 years old. Just to be clear on what he looked like. So it sort of made sense right? This is\nhim as our CFO, I think this is him at 29. But it looked like we were going to run off with the money and go to Disneyland. I\nappreciate why they didn't think we could pull it off. I can't imagine giving him money.\nSo, we decided that we still have to go do it. We have to give this our best shot. We are going to take the scale, the\nconsumer experience, the DNA of our company and we are going to see if we can bring this into the enterprise. We were\nreally fortunate. We had an investor, early in his career, make a belief on us because there was something changing with\nthe enterprise that we would be able to take advantage of.

What about the sales process is very slow can change in this new era?\nHow do we move and go directly to the user the customer, instead of having this really indirect process at getting our\ntechnology out there? How do we build a design for the user instead of just for the RFP process that a customer is going\nto go through? So we looked at all of the factors that are true with the enterprise and we are going to do, not in all cases,\nthe opposite. We are going to find what has changed in the technology world that we can build a newer, and better\nsoftware company. That was the decision we embarked on, the path we embarked on 8 years ago. And that is why we\nhave been focused on enterprise.\nToday, again we have about two hundred and forty thousand businesses using the product. And the reason is we\narchitected the business model, we architected the software, we architected the solution to work in one specific version of\nthe world, and it turned out that one solution was the one that happened. And I will go a little bit into what has changed in\nthe world that we sort of built our company around. And what I would highly recommend to you, if you are building an\nenterprise software company to orient to your technology. So that was sort of why we made the decision, how we started\nto take on the problem.\nSo everything about enterprise, and by definition the software that the enterprise uses, has changed just in the past 5\nyears. If there ever was a magical time to build an enterprise software company, now is that time in terms of how much\nhas changed in what is going on with organizations. Lets go over a couple of these things. The first is that most\napplication companies are moving to the cloud. And the biggest thing is, if you are going to start a business management\ncompany, or a business intelligence company, even a contact management company years ago you had to have you\nidea implemented in every single customer location. No matter how many customers you sold to, no matter what region\nyou were in, every customer had to put that in their datacenter. That was the flaw with on premise computing. You were\ndoing all this work, you were creating so much redundancy, it was the slowing down the whole process of delivering and\nbuilding software for the enterprise. All of a sudden the cloud came around, things like Sales Source. com, things like\nAmazon Web Services, basically said. Why is it that every customer that wants to implement a couple servers, have to\nimplement servers, put them in their data server, but security or networking around them, six months later they go live and\na developer can use them in the organization, same thing with an application? They said, why does that make any sense\ntoday? We could just put together tens of thousands of servers, put them on demand, and you can use whatever you\nwant, when you want and we can do that. That obviously is the definition of Cloud Computing. What's happening is CIO\u2019s\nand large enterprises are taking advantage of this. So it seems obvious to everyone in this room because you would\nnever build your company by buying your own servers. You would start is on google, yahoo, or ashore rather. But to an\nenterprise there are decades of infrastructure that now has to move to that cloud. So thats a massive shift that is actually\nhappening.\nWe are moving to a world of cheaper, on demand computing from a world of expensive computing. The benefit of starting\na startup is the customers don't have the same friction,, they are going to go and adopt new technology. As soon as the\ncomputing becomes cheaper, its easier to adopt new solutions. Which means, their barrier for showing you in--the barrier\nis a lot lower which is great for startups. We are going from a world of customized platforms to standardize softwares. It\nuse to be that you had to build all the customizations, all the customer experiences on top of the software itself and now\ncustomers are realizing that they won't open platforms and they can customize a layer on top of the product.

So the fact that you can now serve a small business anywhere\nin the world, as well as some of the largest on the planet means there are much larger markets you can go after. Which\nmakes it an even better economical proposition to go after the enterprise. The platforms themselves are becoming more\nglobal. Our customers were internationally a couple weeks after starting the company. If you would have done enterprise\nthe traditional way that would have take years to actually be able to go internally.\nAnd finally, the most profound shift of all, mobile devices. iPhones, iPads, Androids, Tablets, IT of these models have\nbecome a lot more user led. It's fundamentally important. In an IT world, incumbents generally win because they have the\nexisting relationship with the IT organization, with the CIO, with the spending power of that company. In a user lead\nmodel, users are bringing in their own technology.

So those are quantitative factory changes. Just a couple quantitative changes, there is over nearly 2 billion\nsmart phones on the planet. That changes every single IT model planet. Because it use to be 10 years ago, if you were\nmanaging technology for the company, you just had to manage the computers network that was inside your building. But\nnow with billions of smart phones you have to manage ways of computing anywhere at any time on any network. And that\nbecomes big in software companies, because no incumbent has built a technology stack that powers this line of work and\nhow enterprises are using their data. So that creates a massive start up opportunity.\nThere are nearly 3 billion people online. That means that every single enterprise is changing how they are going to give\ntheir own products to their customers. Which means that every industry changes. There are only two times, two moments\nof opportunity where a technology revolution will happen in an enterprise. The first is where raw materials change. So\ncost of computing goes down and they centralize and let people use it on demand. The second thing that can change, is\nthe very people that these enterprises have to go after need new experiences at that enterprises product. Let me give you\nan example. If you go off campus you probably use something like Uber or Lyft. If you are in the shipping business, if you\nare in the transportation business, Uber represents a massive change to your industry. So you can't let Uber exist without\nunderstanding, what are the implications of Uber? What are the implications of Instacart? What are the implications of Lyft\nto my business model?\nSo in a world where enterprises are dealing with that kind of change, you are going to need new technology to help them\ncreate their business models, how they adapt to this disruption. This is why it's such an amazing time to even start vertical\nsoftware companies for industries. Right now every single industry is going through a business model and technology\norientated disruption. Means they are going to need technology from start ups to help them work through this. I will give\nyou a couple of examples: so in the retail industry there's this vision of omni channel or multichannel commerce. You are\ngoing to shop online, you are going to shop on your phone, you are going to shop in a store, and you want things to be\ndelivered to you as well. So most of the incumbent technology does not power multichannel commerce. No one is\nprepared, what does it mean when consumers want to go buy goods anytime from anywhere with better information,\nbetter intelligence. So every retailer in the world is going to need a new technology stack to power their retail\nexperiences.\nIn the healthcare space, every single health care institution is trying to find ways of building more personalized\nexperiences, more predictive experiences, they want to have medicine be adapted to the individual. As the business\nmodel of healthcare changes to being about the surgery, charging for the check up, and instead, really where the\ncustomer pays for the wellness and staying healthy. Then all of a sudden every healthcare institution needs technology to\ndeliver health care experiences. They are going to want to deliver telemedicine. They are going to want to deliver health\ncare in more regional locations instead of just in the monolithic hospital environment. There are going to be new use\ncases coming around. How are our healthcare providers get connected to one another so one doctor can make better\ndecisions? All of these things are going to require new enterprise software to power these businesses and industries.\nIn the media space, as an example, you have a world where the industry is going from really linear programming,\nwhether that's television or that's music or that's movies, it's a linear supply chain oriented business model, when a film\ngets made, it goes to the theater for 3 months, then afterwards it goes to iTunes or other platforms, to a world where\npeople want experiences on demand. So that's going to change how distribution works on a scale of 3 billion people on\nthe internet, and again no media network has a platform that is actually going to power how content, data, and\ninformation moves to this system at scale.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4550, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c48c707-1317-4be5-aeb9-1cac70e9cbb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c48c707-1317-4be5-aeb9-1cac70e9cbb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f6a9ede-b98f-4560-bbe1-8d5e297d6474", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "926af53bba9d091e5d22d8533cf4ba1abfbde6b3cb291072126862a9eec8f807", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f492f71a-cb62-4594-a8e6-40987e0734ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "353551fdd142188b19a0ca2af9be9334c7284c123990be5883f8d4fec4a2ff47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "02ca8de8-8954-4874-b577-edd2b2abce0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58e8e36646c986fb8354a0aab7a3b0f3d6238a29f0e87d5a4fda79825ad8343a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f9eceabe396eb15f53ad511f7727d7017fd20e557809f57fb6248e22bb1c905d", "text": "There are going to be new use\ncases coming around.

Think of the future of water, who is going to power that? That's\ngoing to need software, I'm sure.\nSo basically every company in the world, the great thing about being at Stanford is we study the technology. And we think\nof the technology industry as an industry. But in reality what is happening, is every industry is going to have a technology\ncomponent of what they do. Enterprises are not going to be able to survive in the future if they do not get good at\ntechnology. If they don't have competency at leveraging data and using these new tools. But they are going to do that by\nworking with what we call the technology industry.\nInstead of everyone else building out in these expertise for themselves. So there's going to be a lot of partnership over\nthe next five to ten years where companies are going to need technology to work smarter, to work faster, they are going to\nneed to do this more securely. And this is not only going to change how individuals work in these environments but\nultimately change the business models of these companies. So that was chapter two of this.\nNow I'll give you some practical advice to help you get started. To be fair, most of this advice is looking through the lens of\nretrospect which means this is not how this is going to happen, but I can look back through time and say that these are\nthe things that led this to be true. It's hard to be deterministic about building a company. You may not have all these things\nfigured out, but this will give you a sense of pattern to recognize as you are building or thinking about building an\nenterprise software company.\nSo the first one is spot technology disruptions. This is going to be true whether you are building consumer or enterprise.\nThe rest are more enterprise, but this is just fundamental if you are going to build a tech company. You have to look for\nnew enabling technologies, or major trends, like fundamental trends, that create a wide gap between how things are\ndone and how they can be done. Looking back in time to our business, the gap was basically storage was getting\ncheaper, internet was getting faster, browsers where getting better yet we are still sharing files with this very complicated,\nvery cumbersome means. Anytime, between the delta of what is possible, and how things work today is at its widest. That\nis an opportunity to build new technology to go solve a problem. As you are looking at the enterprise, the question is,\nwhat about the cost of computing dropping so rapidly changes what enterprises can do with their data?\nWhat does it do to change from a business standpoint? What was impossible, because of either economic feasibility or\ntechnical feasibility that 10-15 years ago is now possible. A fun thing to do every now and then, if you find a newspaper\narticle from the 1990\u2019s or 1980\u2019s, business articles about technology, all we are really doing is repeating all the\ntechnologies we tried 10, 20, 30 years ago. It was too expensive, too unusable, and we didn't have the enabling\ntechnologies to make it possible. You can see this concept emerge, something that was impossible 5, 10 years ago is\nnow very practical. I will give you an example. There is a company called PlanGrid, does anyone know what PlanGrid\ndoes? Okay, cool. Are you in the construction industry? You are? Oh my god! What does that even mean?\nQ: PlanGrid? Or construction?\nAaron Levie: Construction.\nQ: I work at a job site, we build buildings.\nAaron Levie: Holy crap, that's great. Basically PlanGrid is a mobile application that lets you manage construction projects,\nlets you access your blueprints, lets you manage all the data around a construction process. And what this company\nrealized is, 4 billion dollars, I think, are spent every year printing out blueprints. And they have all the prints and updates\nto them anytime there a change, then they have to ripple and cascade through a very wide network of contractors and\nconstruction workers every time. Even if it's one slight, minute change, suddenly they realized, with the iPad, we have the\nperfect form factor to load up blueprints and content.

But something that you think over time expands to\nbe a more important product of the enterprise structure. What you want to start to do is say, we will take this sliver of a\nproblem, we are going to make the user experience on the incredible. We are either going to change the business model,\nwe are going to create new technology to make this previously problem really really simple. It might feel small at first,\nmaybe you are going after small businesses and then you are going to go up market. Maybe you are starting with a sliver\nof the use case and expand out, but you intentionally start small. Because you will not be able to compete with an\nincumbent because the incumbent is always going to go for the full solution. So you have to find, what are the gaps in the\nfull solution, that are significant enough that the customer is going to want to solve the problem with a discreet\ntechnology. But over time you are going to be able to expand. Again to either larger customers or to more use cases over\ntime.\nGreat example is ZenPayroll. ZenPayroll was started by Stanford graduates couple of years ago. Basically, they\ndiscovered that the payroll is some small business is complicated and incredibly annoying process. That is because we\nuse the same vendors that we have for decades to do that and they were digitally ordinated. You didn't get your payments\nas a receipt over email. Very complicated. You didn't get to see graphs of your salaries. There was really no good data\naround this. And they said we are going to take off the slice that is most painful to start out at, around hiring people and\npaying people. Just that payroll management process. We are going to plug into a lot of existing structure. But we are\ngoing to make it dead simple to go do this. And now they are able to move up market over time as well as deliver new\nservices over time. And what happens is the incumbent in this market, eventually looks at something like Zen Payroll and\nsays, well thats small. Its only for small businesses\u2019. How can it be very powerful? But thats just the start. As they get that\nwedge, as they fit into the market, they are going to be able to expand again over time. Build out more services and more\ncapabilities. But they found just the right, exact opening to build a new company and have the emerge.\nThen next you really want to find asymmetries. You want to do things that incumbents can't or won't do because either the\neconomics don't make sense for them, the economics are so unusual, or because technically they can't. I will give you\ntwo examples. So, if you are going to build software today for the enterprise that goes after an incumbent category, that\nhas more of a suite? oriented approach. Then what you are going to want to do is build technology that is platform\nagnostic. What suite players will do is want everything to be integrated with itself, and theres more value with the vertical\nintegration. But you want to go after a different access. Which you want your technology to work across all the platforms.\nThat way you can work with so many different kinds of customers. You can be an ally to so many kinds of platforms, which\na traditional incumbent is not able to do. That is technically infeasible because its architecture or its a fundamental\ncomponent business model to not do that. The other thing is, trying to do things that is economic feasible. You can look at\nthe cost structure of an incumbent company and discover where they are not going to be able to drop their prices.\nBecause that business model is fundamental to the company. Or where can you find ways of monetizing the customer\nthat are unusual or unique that no one has discovered before, thus making impractical for anyone else to do.\nThere is a company called Zenefits where they have an HR management software company that helps you as a small\nstartup manage all your benefits, all your HR information. And instead of charging the startup that may not value the\nsoftware stage they are at, they realize they can get commission from the insurance companies that pays for the ability to\nuse their software.

Thats an easy way to spot trends\nand patterns about disruption that is playing out. The same is true in the workplace. If you find customers that are working\nin the future, you will be able to work with them to find what is missing in the future. And how do we build technology that\nsupports all these new use cases that are going to emerge? There is a company called Skycatch that does enterprise\ndrones.

What is unique, or new about how those businesses operate. And they worked with a lot of those early adopters\nto establish their platform. Which really is first enterprise drone company. So the idea is, go look at your market. Find the\ncustomers on the bleeding edge of their market who use technology to get a head. And that use technology for\nperformance advantages, and go work with them to see how your product can evolve.\nListen to your customers but don't always build exactly what they are telling you. This is a really key distinction around\nbuilding enterprise software. Your customers are going to have a large number of requests. Your job is to instill those lists\ndown into the ultimate product. This does not mean that you are not going to build exactly what they tell you to build. It is\nyour job to listen to their problems, and translate those into what is going to build the best and simplest solution for them.\nIt's really your job, and Palantir does a really good example of very very complex issues and then scaling them down into\nsimple solutions for complex problems that the customer would not have known how to ask for.\nYou want to modularize not customize. So build a platform as opposed to building all the custom technology and\ncustomer vertical experiences into the software itself. Make sure you really think about openness and APIs as a way of\nbuilding experiences. Don't build that directly into the product. Focus on the user always. The magical thing about\nbuilding an enterprise software company right now is you can keep consumer information at the center of the product.\nThat will always mean that adoption is easier, that your product has a much better chance of going viral. It becomes\neasier to sell in the organization. Always make sure you bring consumer DNA into the product. Your product should sell\nitself. But that does not mean you don't need sales people. So this is a really important distinction. Leverage everything\nabout the internet, leverage everything about users to get to your customers. But you still will likely need sales as a way to\nhelp your customers navigate your product, help your customers navigate the competitive landscape and ecosystem. So\nyou are going to want very domain specific sales associates that are going to be helpful for your customer in deploying\nenabled in these positions. But don't make that be a substitute, don't make that be a handicap for not building a great\nproduct. So you fundamentally build a product inside that. A company called Mixpanel comes in through the developer\nand eventually sells to that organization with a more inside sales process. Also read these three books: Crossing the\nChasm, the Innovators Dilemma, and Behind the Cloud.

How do you think about what the skill set is? And what are the things you should\nbe thinking about in terms of: am I ready? How do I get ready? Is it the right thing for me? These sorts of things.\nSo let's start with the perception of what a great founder is. And classically this tends to be Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon\nMusk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos. And it's an image of founder as Superwoman, or Superman, who has this panopticon\nof skills. I can use the word panopticon because I am here at Stanford. It's things like, I can do product market fit. I am\ngreat at product, I am great at strategy, I am great at management. I can fundraise. I can do all of these skills and the thing\nyou are looking for in a great founder, in the idea of the founder as a super person, is I am looking for someone who is\nawesome at all these things. They are well rounded, they are diverse. They can bat on all skills.\nAnd part of how I found this emphasized, in the beginning of my own entrepreneurial journey, I remember reading an\narticle that said Bill Gates is smarter than Einstein. And you are like, Bill Gates is really smart and is very accomplished,\nbut I am not sure smarter than Einstein is really a phrase that even Bill Gates wants to be next to. It's partially because of\nthis image of a founder as super person. Which is, a great founder can do anything. Jump over tall buildings in a single\nbound, all of these sort of things. And the reality is that a founder is someone who deals with all these different\nheadaches and no one is universally powered.\nGenerally speaking you hope to have a couple super powers. Some things that are a unique edge to you, some things\nthat are unique to the problem you are trying to solve, some things that will help you get an edge. Because competitive\ndifferentiation and competitive edge is super important. But it's not actually a function of genius.\nAnd frequently it's very hard to tell the difference between madness and genius because usually it's the results that play\nout. Sometimes when dealing with uncertain environments you may even be genius and later may be thought to be a\nmad person. Or you may be a mad person and turn out lucky, you may turn out genius. It's actually a challenging set of\nhow do you think about these sets of skills. And when us, mere mortals come into this sort of battle, what is the right way\nto think about it?\nSo when I thought about this question, on how is one a great founder, these are all skills that are super important. These\nare all things that you say, okay, this is really really important to do and you must in fact do this well. And it begins to look\nlike a superhuman task. And what I did was decide to take a superset of these and focus on the interesting things to think\nabout. What is it that actually makes a great founder? Because it's not actually that you score ten out of ten of these, you\nbecome the entrepreneurial olympian. You are actually the best at all these things.\nSo let's start with team. One way, I think, to explode the myth of super founder is usually it's best to have two or three\npeople on a team rather than a solo founder. It's not to say that solo founders don't actually play out and they can,\nsuccessfully. But most often two or three people is much better. When I look at these things as an investor, and I say what\nis a good composition of a project and founders that are likely to succeed, it's usually two or three of them. And the\nreasons are, we have already talked about that there's this very broad set of skills. There is this whole set of questions on\nhow you adapt your company or be successful. If you have two or three founders, you have different skills you can\ncompensate. Because, by the way, everyone has weaknesses. You can compensate for each others weaknesses.

That is not\nalways but frequently fatal. And also the diversity of the tasks that you do.

The reason why\nSilicon Valley startups are so successful is because all of these great people--immigration which is hugely important for\ntalent and founders that immigrate here. Now if you think about it from basic math, even if you take something that Silicon\nValley is super strong at, which is essentially software skills in the last two decades, not all the great software companies\nmove here. Not all of them can move here. There are many of them in other various parts of the world. And so why do I\nput choice of location up there? It's one of the things it comes down to in thinking whether or not you are a great founder.\nWell the reason is, because of what great founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their task. And they\nrealize it's not just about, I am superman, I can do this anywhere. I can do this in Antarctica, etc, in order to be successful, I\nhave to go to where the strongest networks are for the particular kind of thing that I am doing. And Silicon Valley, by the\nway, is super good at some kind of tasks, some places that you essentially try to solve certain types of problems. But it's\nnot good at all of them. Let me take two examples.\nOne is Groupon, I don't think Groupon could have ever been founded here. Even though it's a software product, it even\ngenerates a network. Obviously a lot of the great networks are here and use internet technology as a mobile product and\neverything else. All of which we have a lot of great skill here in Silicon Valley and the networks are really good for this.\nOne of the things that was central for Groupon for it's early days, was having massive sales forces. And a massive sales\nforces, strengthens and weakens a workforce, tends to go together. Silicon Valley, tends to be pretty adverse to plans that\ninvolve, Oh we are going to rent a twenty-five story building and in twenty of those stories we are going to have floors of\nsales people. And thats how we are going to get our thing going. That kind of plan here tends to not get a lot of interest,\ntends to get a lot of criticism, tends to not have talent aggregate to it, tends to have financiers talk about things like cap\nefficiency, and network effects, and other kinds of things that are key here. And so it's actually not a surprise that in fact,\nGroupon was required to be in Chicago, which is really good at this, as a way of getting going and showing that even\nsoftware startups can be in other places. But even if you begin to think about it, you say what kind of other kinds of\nstartups would someone be an idiot to move here to do.\nThink of someone doing a fashion start up, not fashion a la Poshmark which is a mobile marketplace that are a bunch of\nthings good here. But I'm designing a new fashion company. And I'm going to come to Silicon Valley to do it. That's\nactually not a great idea. The fashion company might be a great idea but you want the networks that support what you are\ndoing. So part of the reasons why, where should I locate my start up, is a test for thinking about am I great founder is\nbecause part of the thing that happens when you are founding a company is, I will go to where this is successful to do.\nThe metaphor I often use for entrepreneurship is jumping off a cliff while assembling an airplane on the way down. And\nthe reason I do is because it's hard, it has a quasi mortal exit, which are default dead so you start taking every possible\nchance to actually win. So great founders will move to where the network is. This network is graphically Silicon Valley for\ntech startups, for mobile, for marketplaces this is a really good place to do it. For a bunch of other things, you should think\nabout a different location.\nNow here is something that's very en vogue. Very conventional to say you're a contrarian these days. So let's talk a little\nabout what what a contrarian actually is. So it's actually pretty easy to become contrarian. It's hard to be contrarian and\nright.

Particularly when you are thinking about, is my idea contrarian or contrarian enough. How does a smart person\nactually disagree with me? Because if you can't think of a smart person who isn't just ignorant or just crazy or anything\nelse, but is a smart person that is somewhat of an expert may think that your idea has some serious challenges than it\nactually isn't contrarian. Contrarian is relevant to an audience. So when you are thinking about contrarian in terms of a\nreally good contrarian idea is like, say it's consumer internet, okay what would other consumer internet people think is\nactually in fact not a good idea. And part of when you think about contrarian is to say, okay what do I know that others\ndon't know? Because it isn't just, oh I'm brilliant and other people aren't, it's the reason my contrarian thing is right. It's a\nvery bad test, that happened to be true, of course lightening can strike you in the field. So think a lot about what is it that I\nknow that other people don't know. For example, in the very early days of LinkedIn, part of what I advise all founders to do\nis talk to every smart person who will talk to you and give you feedback. So with LinkedIn I walked around and said here's\nmy idea, what do you think?\nTwo thirds or more of my network, including some very smart people, all thought I was nuts. The reason why they thought\nI was nuts was because I said it's a network product, it's only valuable with a bunch of people in it. The first person has no\nvalue until they invite the second one. Second person, first person have no value in it they already know each other.\nWhen do you actually begin to deliver on your use case, which is 500K to a million people.

It's never going to grow. Now what I knew was that the critics didn't know was that I could think of a set of\ndifferent way by which people would say hey look I believe in the vision of this. I think it's interesting, or I think a product\nlike this should exist, or I'm willing to play around with it. And I can level those sets of interest to grow the network to get to\nenough size that you can begin to deliver on the value propositions which Linkedin had. And that was the specific thing\nthat I knew that the critics weren't thinking about. So when you think about being contrarian, you have to think about how\nis it that smart people disagree with me, that disagree with me from a position of intelligence. And there is something that I\nknow that they don't know that will actually play out to be true. Now in this case, in general, as a founder it's good to be\ncontrarian in the real sense.\nNow the last part on the contrariness is to think about, there are lots of different ways to be contrarian. For example, a\nfrequent one will be, others think you have a good small idea, but actually that's not small, it's large. Or actually in fact you\ncan assemble the talent or while most consumer cellular startups tend to be, another LinkedIn example, only successful\nwith the rocketships, actually a compounding curve can be very very valuable. LinkedIn never had it's rocketship moment,\nit was compounded year by year. But in consumer internet that becomes atypical in the pattern.\nSo here you begin to get to a bunch of sorts of problems that essentially founders run into. Well should I be doing the\nwork? Or should I be recruiting people and delegating the work? And classically the answer to this is, actually in fact you\nneed to do both. In fact, not only do you need to do both, you need to sometimes do one at 100% and sometimes the\nother at 100% and even though this is not so good at math, both at 100%. And so what you will see, this is sometimes\nclassic, when you start thinking about what makes you a great founder, is you navigate what are apparent paradoxes.\nAnother one I frequently talk about is, you've got to be both flexible and persistent. And the reason for this is\nentrepreneurs are frequently given the advice to have a vision, stay firm against your adversity. Realize that you have this\nvision that is contrarian to what people think and just stay on track. Get through the difficult times and get there. The other\npiece of advice given with each equal vigor is listen to data, listen to customers. Pivot, be flexible. Part of the thing this\ncomes out to be in terms of being a great founder is to say well, when should I be persistent and when should I be\nflexible. And the vehicle I most often use for this is you should have a project you are doing, like a company, an\ninvestment, a thesis that essentially says why you think, possibly contrarian, why you think it is potentially a good idea. It\nshould include what you know you think other people don't know.\nAnd then as you are going into the battlefield, you go am I in fact increasing confidence in my investment thesis? Or\ndecreasing value in my investment thesis? Because if I am increasing confidence then I hope to stay on track. Be\npersistent and, by the way, sometimes even with adversity your confidence can increase. If it's decreasing that doesn't\nmean jump out. Paypal, LinkedIn, Airbnb, a whole bunch of startups I've been a part of have had months where you are\nlike, Oh my god why did we ever think this was a good idea? It's kind of a valley in the shadows moment.

Where you are\ngoing, okay is this changing my investment thesis? Is this changing what I am planning on doing? It doesn't mean you\nlose confidence, you have the confidence but you also essentially have the patience. Again in this kind of thing is how do\nyou put these two things together. Should I focus internally? Should I build a product, ignore the world, ignore\ncompetitors? Or should I focus externally, should I be recruiting? Should I be meeting people? Should I be gathering\nnetwork intelligence? Again the answer is both. And the reason why I'm focusing on these type of habits, it's both rather\nthan either or, is part of what makes a great founder is the ability to be flexible across these lines. To sometimes be 90%\none way, sometimes be 80% the other way. Be executing the judgement on what does the current problem look like?\nHow is it that when I am trying to solve this that I should say this is what we should be doing and how should I be dividing\nthe work? Part of when you think about these things is you say, this is another one that is classic, is people say well I am\ncompletely motivated by data its what customers say to user groups.

And the data can even be negative\nand you can think, well actually in fact this negative data means that I need to change or alter the way that I'm thinking\nabout something. But I actually keep on a specific vision about what I'm doing. And by the way, sometimes when you\nhave the specific vision you don't necessarily actually ever end up at that big vision that you were thinking about.\nSo for example, you know at PayPal we distributed these tshirts that said the new global world currency. Well actually in\nfact, I know Peter has been here, one of the jokes I told Peter was actually we do have this new world currency, what we\nare trading is in dollars you may have heard of it, it existed for a while. Where essentially a mass merchant for that-- now\nof course this is message is what's happening with Bitcoin though thats a whole nother topic there. However, the key\nthing is that vision saying we\u2019re creating a universal network that allows anyone to pay anyone to be a merchant to bring\nthe electronics into the speed of commerce at any business that is being transacted. That vision kept a true north, but first\nwe say well first we are going to have a banking model, then we think we are going to have a debt model, we are actually\ngoing to have a mass merchant model. How does that actually play out? So you are always combining the vision and the\ndata, and data is within the framework of the vision. And sometimes the course of what you learn changes your vision.\nNow this is actually one of the ones that I we save this special picture for one of the ones that I actually think is quite key.\nNormally entrepreneur founders are thought about as being the risk takers. Where everyone else cowers in fear at this\nnotion of risk, they boldly go out. Now that's true, you have to be a risk taker, you have to be thinking about how do I make\na really coherent risk because in fact the only really big opportunities, the only contrarian opportunities smart people\ndisagree with you on happen to be ones that have more risks associated with them. On the other hand, part of the skill\nset, that when you are beginning to apply how you think about risks as an entrepreneur is how do I take intelligent risks?\nHow do I take a focused risk, but if I'm right about that one thing then a bunch of other things break my way. And once I\nstart doing that I try to figure out how to make my own shot possibility as high as possible? How do I minimize other risks?\nHow do I essentially take this risk in an intelligent way that doesn't just go, oh yeah risk to the wind who cares but lets go.\nSo this kind of combines that, this image is the best of the images that we found, is kind of the sense of that. Now back to\nwhat I was saying in terms of having an investment thesis.\nPart of having a thesis is you chart it out as a list of bullets. For example with LinkedIn, everyone was going to be\nbenefited by a public professional network, everyone will realize, including companies, that it's better to have it play out\nthis way. The initial setup adoption will come from essentially people who visualize the world, play with it, and eventually\nthe mass market will come on as they begin having a network, that is already having a network, with value proposition to\nthem. That's what an investment thesis can look like and then you have economics, initially recruiting, and broadening\nthose things.\nYou have that investment thesis, and you say is my investment thesis increasing or decreasing confidence? Do I think\nthat the data that I get from the market, when I talk to smart people, how does that change my confidence in it? This is how\nyou minimize risks. For example, very early days in Paypal, part of what happened was they said they were going to do\ncash and mobile phones with cash on Palm Pilots because its really easy. We actually realized the cash from Palm Pilots\nwouldn't work even before we launched the product. Basically what happened I went in and said to Max and Peter, I said\nhere's our challenge--this group probably doesn't remember what Palm Pilots where, they were early PDA\u2019s. And so we\nlived in what was Palm Pilot central and the whole use case was splitting the dinner tab and everyone at table would\nhave a Palm Pilots budget tab.

Of course that what the whole thing pivoted into. And that is part of thinking though minimizing the\nrisks as you are executing.\nHere's another one that's kind of classic which is, should I have this long term vision or should I be solving a local near\nterm problem? Again the answer is both these paradoxes. And the question is, you should jump between them. You\nshould always have a long term vision in mind because if you actually completely lose your directions eventually you will\nfind yourself somewhere in field thats not a good path out of. But if you are not focused on solving the problem thats\nimmediately in front of you you're hosed. So part of the question about how to put these things together is you say, okay\nshort term- what's the thing I need to be doing today? Have I made progress today? have I made progress this week?

It is more fundamental than what the actual product is. And the one\nbelow it is financing. The reason it's financing is because if you run out of money and the whole effort goes away, even if\nyou have a really good idea, it doesn't work. So frequently when you are executing on a good strategy you are actually in\nfact, when I am raising money, this fundraising, I'm thinking about the next fundraiser. I'm thinking about how I'm set up for\nit, I'm establishing relationships that would be key to that. And I'm not executing like, oh the only thing that matters is I get\nto the next fundraising. You have this business that you are building, but I'm thinking that as a core strategy in terms of\nhow I'm executing frequently you are thinking how does my product distribution work such that the financing works well.\nAnd that's kind of how you architect these things together.\nSo how do you know you might be a great founder? Well you should have some super powers. It's generally speaking\nuseful to be a good product person. It's useful to have good skills about leadership, bringing networks in, persuading\npeople, and it's useful to be able to- and this is kind of fundamental, is recognized whether you are on track or not. To\nhave that kind of belief but also paranoid about am I tracking against my investment thesis? And when you do that the\nright way and you are learning and you are assembling people and you are assembling that around you. That's generally\nspeaking how you end up being a great founder. Now classically, and I deliberately put up five white male pictures, is\nclassically you have, these are the iconic founders. But in fact, founders can be very diverse. They can be extraordinarily\ntalented at different areas because there's different kinds of external companies. There's different kinds of problems that\nthey are trying to solve. And I don't mean diversity in term of gender, race, etc. Diversity in age, diversity in experience.\nJack Ma was a teacher before he got into this. That's the kind of thing that you should think about.\nSo the question is how you cross uneven ground? How you assemble networks around you? How you get people to\nassemble? It's a constantly changing problem to face when you are trying to found a company. So I think the thing I was\ntrying to get people to think about was, this is to say, there is not one skill set, there is an ability to learn and adapt. And an\nability to constantly have a vision that's driving you but to be taking input from all sources and then to be creating\nnetworks all around you. And that's essentially what makes a great founder. So your ability to do that while crossing\nuneven ground in the fog, which is kind of the way entrepreneurs, did you always know this was going to work? No,\nunless you are crazy. Although sometimes crazy works. So with that I will now go to a few questions. But it was kind of this\nmindset of founders which is kind of key. And if theres' no questions, oh here.\nQ: I'm curious how you targeted, you selected a different strategy to strengthen your investment thesis and help it take off.\nIt seems like every startup faces that same challenge.\nA: So one really fundamental thing is to think about product distribution as key. And for LinkedIn we had a couple things\ngoing for us. One, the web was boring in 2003. Basically what happened was everyone thought that consumer net was\nover. So people were doing clean tack and enterprise software and everything else. It's a much harder problem now.\nBecause everyone thinks the internet and mobile is interesting. So breaking through the noise is really the key. So the\nstrategy we used wouldn't work.

I\u2019ll play with it theres not a lot of other things for me to look at. Today theres tons of things.

If you want to get time and attention with\nme, find a reference. That's not a pitch to using LinkedIn, it's a question of this is how you sort out time. Like Sam knows\nme, and so a reference to me is in fact the way I do this. So example, when I met with the AirBnB guys a part of the reason\nwhy I could interrupt them two minutes into their pitch and say, Im going to make you an offer to invest. I want to hear the\nrest of the pitch because I think what you are doing here is magical and awesome. Was because I had already had\nreferences on them. That was only two minutes, not thirty minutes. Because I had already knew about them before\ncoming in. And by the way, by and large that is some version of what is true to most great investors. And its that network\nthat's really key.\nQ: Do you believe destiny of insight to be a great signal for great founders?\nA: I would definitely say that the ability to say coherently what you are targeting, to articulate something that isn't trying to\nboil the ocean, or a swiss army knife approach. One focus, like you are right about this and it works. That is actually pretty\nimportant in being able to judge a founder. Because if you don't have that level of clarity, you are not going to be able to\nassemble the network behind you. You are not going to be able to get investors, you are not going to be able to get\nemployees, you have to be able to articulate a very clear mission about what you are doing. Insight is helpful although a\nlittle bit of this depends on the stage. I find myself attracted to founders who have analyzed the problem in a good way.\nBut often times I have seen great founders who have not present good analysis but have an instinct about what they are\ndoing. So you more chart what is going on around them.\nQ: How do you keep persistence when starting?\nA: Well LinkedIn went through, for those of you who remember we were treated as the little alternative to Friendster, then\nMyspace, then Facebook. We had a lot of the, we are the little tiny one next to these respected giants each at the time.\nUltimately, for me when I was thinking LinkedIn, this gets back to the investment thesis as a mechanism. I continued to\nbelieve the right economic system designed for every individual's life, and organizations life to have public professional\nprofiles. But that world is the way the world should be. everyone is much better off with it. And we are getting closer to that\nthan everyone else. It may be that it hasn't taken off as fast as I would have liked it. It may be that the general world has\ngone, oh the social stuff is really interesting. We could only get in the news the summer of 2003 by saying we were\nFriendster but for business. It's completely nonsensical once you begin to look at the thing. But it was like, okay we will\ncover you because you are Friendster but for business. But that was important to get people to begin to pay attention to\nus and so the confidence was, that world I still have confidence in, I still believe should exist and no one is getting closer\nto it than we. It's taking us maybe longer than I hoped to get there but thats okay.\nQ: What is it that gets you wrong about someone who is going to do the distance?\nA: To some degree you can only fully cross these minefields by going and doing it. So you can be wrong about your\nhypothesis. The kinds of things that frequently get you wrong or you think a person--- for example I frequently use in\ninteraction is I push on the idea and what I'm looking for is both the flexibility and persistence. What I'm looking for is, I\nhave conviction, and what I'm thinking I'm arguing it. But I am listening to what you are saying. And I am adapting to the\nconcerns you have with that. Sometimes you will find someone that says, look I have learned to mimic that behavior so I\nhave learned to say, for example I have learned to look like I am reasoning with you and I look like I am thinking about the\nchallenges you bring up, but actually in fact I am ignoring you.

Most often the kind of reference\nquestions asked about founders is adaptability, one of the phrases I look for is infinite learning curve. Because each\nentrepreneurial pattern is to some degree unique and new. And can you learn the new one? Does the learning break\ndown or is there some skill set? is there an ego issue that gets in the way? Like everyone must adulate me and that will\ncause you to behave wrongly in adapting to the problem. I think I have one last question.\nQ: What makes a great co-founding team and what makes a good way to evaluate a co-founder?\nA: The first thing is, it's super important to collaborate really well.

Frequently you need one technical founder, at least. Frequently you need\nsomeone that is going to be dedicated to the business side for fundraising, these sort of things. A classically skill set and\nusually its some composition across them. Its kind of what you think of founders one, when you think about a founding\nteam. When you get the next level deep, one of the things people classically tell you is don't invest in a husband and wife\nteam. And that adds a little extra freight to it and everything else because the is extra dynamics and all that.\nI actually think what you are looking for is, do they collaborate well. Do they help each other get to truth? So for example, I\nam most part when I am talking to a team. I am looking for when they are reasoning to each other, not just all singing from\nthe same thing. But did you think about this? Or what about this as a challenge? You are navigating the field of battle\nwhich is a bunch of risks. For example, one of the things that was pretty common in Paypal is, Max who invented the prod\nsystems and everything else, would frequently come into Peter's office, Peter Thiel, and say here are some things that are\ngoing to kill us and let me focus you on them. So it's not like we are all saying oh yes we are all singing our Kumbayas but\nwe are adjusting to what is truth and what is the problem we need to solve? And what's the problem in short term and\nwhat's the problem in long term? How are we tackling it? And that collective problem solving, that collective learning is\nthe kind of thing that actually makes a great teams.\nQ: So different founders, different areas. How do you identify them?\nA: The talk was aimed at what is unique about the mindset I think of founders. There is great founder across all. All\nfounders-- there are differences. For example, in software speed to market, speed to learning is really key. In hardware if\nyou screw it up you are dead. So accuracy really matters. If you build and ship the wrong thing you are hosed. So\ngenerally speaking as an investor, and this is part of the reason a lot of investors have a certain set of things they learn\nreally well and reapply, is because they try to understand a domain really well to be able to identify which of the founders\nin this domain really matter and if we are investing in this domain how do we do that well? So there are attributes that are\nunique per domain. for example, one of the classic ones is, how good must you be at operational efficiencies in terms of\nmargins, cost control, etc. You are dealing in the worlds of atoms including in commerce, you have to be really good at\nthat. You are doing a digital game, like a Zing start up it doesn't matter at all, right? So you look for that sort of fit\nsomewhere. Part of the beginning of this is that it's not in fact one person is good at at everything. One of the funniest\nconversations I had with a friend of mine who works for me at my first start up, Social Net. He looked at me and said, Reid\nI would never hire you to be a manager at McDonalds. I was, I wouldn't either. I would be terrible at that. So its the skill set\nthat fits but also the whole point of this is actually being able to navigate a set of things that look like paradoxes.\nSometimes being heavy on one, sometimes being heavy on the other. And having the right judgement at the moment at\nwhat you are doing and thats what tends to be more universal.\nQ: How do you know when to pivot?\nA: Part of the reason why having an investment thesis and your confidence in the rest of the place and being pretty clear\non that is generally speaking the answer I give to people is if your confidence is unmeasured for a fairly long time or is\ndecreasing, because measured for a long period of time it should be decreasing, then its decreasing and you go into\nintense mode.

Well I tried these three things\nand this fourth thing doesn't seem as good as the other three. The next two things seem even worse. That begins to\ndecrease your confidence. And that is when you should think about pivoting. A frequent mistake when it comes to\npivoting is waiting until you have been crashed into the wall and everything is dead. And you can't maneuver any more.\nAnd thats you waited way too long. Now in times of personal career goals and so forth. One of the things I meant to talk to\nyou during the slide, one of the classic questions is balance. I actually think founders have no balance. One of the\nfunniest conversations I ever had was with the governor of Colorado, was like we are going to attract really great\nentrepreneurs here because we have this balanced lifestyle. Literally if i ever hear a founder talk about how I have a\nbalanced life they are not committed to winning. So the really one great founders are, I am going to literally put everything\ninto doing this. Now it may only be for a couple of years. I may do this for a while but hile I am doing this i am unbalanced.\nYou are super focused on this.

I have watched some of the prior classes and I am going to assume you have hired\na bunch of relentlessly resourceful people, you have built a product that at least some people love, hopefully raised some\ncapital, and now you are trying to build a company. You have been forging a product and now you are forging a\ncompany. And I would actually argue, forging a company is a lot harder than forging a product. Basic reason is people\nare irrational. We all know this. Either your parents, your significant other, your brother or sister, your teacher, somebody\nin your life is irrational. Building a company is basically like taking all the irrational people you know putting them in one\nbuilding, and then living with them twelve hours a day at least. It's very challenging. Now there are some techniques for\ncoping with that some people get good at it, some people don't. But that's really what operating is all about.\nSo basically what you are doing when building a company is building an engine. At first you have a drawing on a white\nboard and you are architecting it, and it looks especially clean, beautiful, and pretty. But when you actually start\ntranslating it to practice it actually starts looking more like this and you're holding it together with duct tape. It takes a lot of\neffort from people to hold it together, that's why people work 80-100 hours a week. It's that heroic effort to keep this thing\ntogether because you don't actually, yet, have polished metal in place. Eventually you want to construct a very high\nperformance machine. A machine that almost nobody really has to worry about every hour, every minute. And as we used\nto joke about at eBay, that if the Martians took over eBay it would take 6 months for the world to notice. That's eventually\nwhat you want to get to.\nAs Warren Buffett says, build a company that idiots could run because eventually they will. So this is what you want.\nBasically a performance machine that idiots can run. Now as a leader, what is your real job, what's your role? Strictly\nspeaking there is only one book ever written that actually explains how to do this. It's rather old, written in 1982 by Andy\nGrove, it's quite famous, and successful. And his definition of what your job is, is to maximize the output of the\norganization. Your organization that you are responsible for, so the CEO\u2019s (responsible for) everything and VP would be\na part of the organization, and the organizations around you. So if you are a VPE, you are actually responsible for the\nperformance of the product team and the marketing team because you have influence there. So this is how you measure\npeople, and you want to focus on the output and not the input. The old adage about measuring motion and confusing\nprogress. You are measuring only progress. And this is going to sound like a fancy and glamorous thing to do. Maybe\npeople get excited about managing a whole large organization and being \u201cresponsible\u201d for the output. But in practice,\nwhat you are going to hopefully learn today is that it's more about things like ordering smoothies, teaching your\nreceptionist how to answer your phone properly, and serving as a $10 an hour TaskRabbit for your employees. So let's\ntalk about that.\nSo at first, when you start a company everything is going to feel like a mess. And it really should. If you have too much\nprocess, too much predictability, you are probably not innovating fast enough and creatively enough. So it should feel like\neveryday there is a new problem and what you are doing is fundamentally triaging. So some things will look like a\nproblem, and they are actually colds, they are just going to go away.

And this is the best metaphor I have ever\nseen in 14 years of running stuff, of how to think about your job. It's a natural metaphor, so it's easy to take with you\neveryday and it's easy to transmit to each of your employees so they can figure out if they are editing or writing. It's a\nnatural construct, you generally know when somebody asks you to do something, am I writing or am I editing? So an\neditor is the best metaphor for your job. And we are going to talk about the specific things you are doing in editing.\nLecture 14: How to Operate\nKeith Rabois", "start_char_idx": 3347, "end_char_idx": 4781, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad57b5ae-79b4-48d5-b483-bf4dd74030b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad57b5ae-79b4-48d5-b483-bf4dd74030b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed4c29a0-ab72-4af6-be68-bd73c5903565", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "fb3222172e061893b1be8899a8424f22d8cf5996715e4c7545862db206a3da15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5dcb37ff-8c04-4b13-9208-526c3808bbbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "123", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "a9e3ac0859a5ff4d603c7dac0f8a983ee2a78cde4dc96c42133422e96aedcdff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1dfc025b-8a27-424d-9b0d-5311039d8824", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4291c5619a1dd7950b6ae436d965d47c77feadb55ab3e04544d1190923f0ed5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "92bc402bac8d33f07a7350b638f28de968a444d12f200d464486a25482ef0d32", "text": "The first thing an editor does and you have all probably had this experience in school, is you submit a paper, to a TA, a\ndraft to your friend, and the first thing that editor does is they take out a red pen, or nowadays you go online, and they start\nstriking things. Basically eliminating things, the biggest task of an editor is to simplify, simplify, simplify and that usually\nmeans omitting things. So that's your job too, is to clarify and simplify for everybody on your team. The more you simplify,\nthe better people will perform. People can not understand and keep track of a long complicated set of initiatives. So you\nhave to distill it down to one, two, or three things and use a framework they can repeat, they can repeat without thinking\nabout, they can repeat to their friends, they can repeat at night.\nDon't accept the excuse of complexity. A lot of people will tell you, this is too challenging, this is too complicated, yeah\nwell I know other people simplify but that's not for me, this is a complicated business. They\u2019re wrong. You can change the\nworld in 140 characters. You can build the most important companies in history with a very simple to describe concept.\nYou can market products in less than 50 characters. There is no reason why you can't build your company the same way.\nSo force yourself to simply every initiative, every product, every marketing, everything you do. Basically take out that red\nand start eliminating stuff.\nSecond thing editors do, is they ask you clarifying questions. When you present a paper to someone, what do they\nusually do? They find some ambiguity somewhere and ask, do you really mean this? Did you really mean that? Give me\nan example of this? That's what your job is. So you are in a meeting, people are going to look to you. And the real thing\nyou do, is you ask a lot of questions. And they can be simple basic questions like should we try this seven days a week?\nOr six days? They can be fundamental questions like, where\u2019s our competitive advantage here? We try to do this as\ninvestors too. Some investors will ask you a billion questions about a billion things and they will have you do diligence\nforever. We try to narrow down to, what are the one two three four things that matter most to this company? And only focus\non those things. So it allows us to be more decisive and we can make decisions rapidly. It allows us not to distract you\nfrom your day job which is actually building a company. And yet still I think we get to the highest fidelity question because\nwe don't have all these extra extraneous details and data. Now it's hard, it's something you have to practice. But when\nyou get good at it, every step you eliminate, Andy Grove estimated you can improve performance by 30-50%.\nNow the next thing you do is you allocate resources. So the editor construct, this is what editors do all the time. They take\neditors from the Mideast, covering the Mideast and they move them to Silicon Valley, because Silicon Valley is more\ninteresting. Or they move them to the sports section because they want to compete on the basis of sports journals and\nother publications. So that can be top down, where I take a whole bunch of resources and people and say, we are now\ngoing over here. We are going to compete on this basis. Then next month, next quarter, next year well that Middle East\ncoverage is getting boring, we don't want to do that anymore. Let's go chase after something else. Or it can be bottom up,\njust like journalists mostly come up with their own stories.\nThe people who work with you, generally, should be coming up with their own initiatives. So a reporter, generally, who\ncovers Google will come up with the interesting stories that they are hearing in ether and propose one or two to their\neditor for approval. But it's not the editor saying, go cover Google and this is the angle I want. Once in a while they do that,\nbut its not the meat and potatoes of what a journalist does every day. Your goal over time is to use less red ink every day.\nSo one way of measuring how well you are doing at communicating or talking to your colleagues about what's important\nand what's not, about why some things are important and why some things are not.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4227, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dfc025b-8a27-424d-9b0d-5311039d8824": {"__data__": {"id_": "1dfc025b-8a27-424d-9b0d-5311039d8824", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed4c29a0-ab72-4af6-be68-bd73c5903565", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "fb3222172e061893b1be8899a8424f22d8cf5996715e4c7545862db206a3da15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad57b5ae-79b4-48d5-b483-bf4dd74030b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "124", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "92bc402bac8d33f07a7350b638f28de968a444d12f200d464486a25482ef0d32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5312886-dbc4-4839-b842-06b8109db3aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1c43b1a5ac64ddcd8a8ae70e79f1f7ee38b74c126f77585e15aaca8f2371e1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4291c5619a1dd7950b6ae436d965d47c77feadb55ab3e04544d1190923f0ed5e", "text": "Let's go chase after something else.

So if any of you read The Economist, you can tell that there is one consistent voice. You can pick up any\narticle, any post in The Economist and it feels like it was written by the same person. Ideally, your company should feel,\non your website, on PR releases, on your packaging if it's a physical product, anywhere on your recruiting pages it should\nfeel like it was written by one person. That's extremely difficult to do. And at first you are going to be tempted to do that\nyourself, which is okay for a founder to do that him or herself initially. Over time you do not want to be doing all of the\nconsistent voice editing by yourself. You want to train people so they can recognize differences in voice.\nSee this website page, it looks very different than this recruiting page. You start asking questions, why is that?

Is one of the leaders over here not really understanding the voice of the company? You have to fix\nthat over time, but you want to start with the objective that everything should feel the same. It's quite difficult to practice,\nalmost every company has one piece of the organization that isn't on the same voice. At Apple, which is notorious, even\nunder Steve's regime, which is notorious for getting this right, if you asked someone who worked at Apple, asked them\nabout the internal tools about recruiting, do they really feel like Apple products? All of them will tell you no. So you are\nnever 100%. But you definitely want to get as close to that as you can.\nNext complicated topic is delegating. So just like the other metaphor on editing is writers do most of the work in the world,\neditors are not writing most of the content in any publication. So that is true of your company, you shouldn't be doing most\nof the work. And the way you get out of most of the work, is you delegate. Now the problem with delegating is that you are\nactually responsible for everything. The CEO, founder, there is no excuse. There is no, there is that department over\nthere, this person over there screwed up. You are always responsible for every single thing, especially when things go\nwrong. So how do you both delegate but not abdicate? It's a pretty tricky challenge, both are sins. You over delegate and\nyou abdicate, or you micromanage, those are both sins. So I'm going to give you a couple techniques for solving this.\nFirst, and this actually came from High Output Management and Andy Grove, is called task relevant maturity. It's a fancy\nphrase for, has this person ever done this before? It's really simple, how mature is this person in doing something? And\nthe more they have done the exact same task before, the more rope you are going to give them. And the more they are\ntrying something new, the more you are going to instruct them and constantly monitor. This is a basic concept but it's\nworth keeping in the back of your brain. The interesting implication, and this is pretty radical, is that any executive, any\nCEO, should not have one management style. Your management style should be dictated by your employee. So with one\nparticular person, you may be very much a micromanager because they are quite low on this scale. And with another\nperson,, you may be delegating a lot because they are quite mature on this scale.\nSo it's actually a good thing if you do reference checks on somebody and half the people you call say they are a\nmicromanager and the other half say they actually give me a lot of responsibility. That's a feature not a bug. I didn't\nunderstand that at first at all. I used to be befuddled when people would do reference checks on me and come back with\nthis complicated mosaic. Then I finally figured out that maybe I was doing my job correctly. So then I taught others that this\nis the way to do it.\nA more nuanced answer that I came up with, is how to make decisions. Delegating vs doing it yourself. You don't want to\ndo it yourself too often. So I basically borrowed from Peter, this is my first two by two matrix ever in my life, but he taught\nme something at least. You basically sort your own level of conviction about a decision on a grate, extremely high or\nextremely low. There's times when you know something is a mistake and there's times when you wouldn't really do it that\nway but you have no idea whether it's the right or wrong answer. And then there is a consequence dimension. There are\nthings that if you make the wrong decision are very catastrophic to your company and you will fail. There are things that\nare pretty low impact. At the end of the day they aren't really going to make a big difference, at least initially.\nSo what I basically believe is where there is low consequence and you have very low confidence in your own opinion,\nyou should absolutely delegate. And delegate completely, let people make mistakes and learn. On the other side,\nobviously where the consequences are dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you are right, you actually\ncan't let your junior colleague make a mistake. You're ultimately responsible for that mistake and it's really important.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4256, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44e6f797-8e3b-4ca2-bb1c-adb3a1133e80": {"__data__": {"id_": "44e6f797-8e3b-4ca2-bb1c-adb3a1133e80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8345d51d-b779-4fdd-a944-c9ecc574aab1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d6f3e8658c8aa6aca69450f0607e64438fdd2c802bd21c6b7027a756683e7626", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5312886-dbc4-4839-b842-06b8109db3aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "b1c43b1a5ac64ddcd8a8ae70e79f1f7ee38b74c126f77585e15aaca8f2371e1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1fb4d31-846d-4361-9683-bbf45f8f277a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f5cf64a180865a565e5282bfab4b0784bc553b61ce35a978dfa30477c876605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "64222e263e6d7140a1df0b073abace28a617e730872893897ab476bc4ead421a", "text": "There's times when you know something is a mistake and there's times when you wouldn't really do it that\nway but you have no idea whether it's the right or wrong answer.

You're ultimately responsible for that mistake and it's really important. You\njust can't allow that to happen. Now the best way to do that is to actually explain your thinking why. It's easy to shortcut\nwhen you get busy explaining ways in the world but it's very important to try.\nWhen I was at LinkedIn, I had a colleague that was quite, quite talented but occasionally would get annoyed if I did not\nagree with his opinion on something. So I would spend a lot of time trying to persuade him why I was making a decision a\ncertain way. And his wild card, his card he would call out if I didn't quite persuade him was, okay you're the boss. And that\nto me was like I was burning a lot of social capital.

Squares would spread Squares to other people and to some extent it was on brand. So it\ndidn't have catastrophic consequences. Each of these ten Squares didn't cost that much money, so financially we could\nafford to do it. But at that time, my ten years of experience said it was not going to work on a meaningful enough scale for\nour metrics and I preferred not to do it. Kyle was so excited about this that I decided to just let him do it. He learned that\nwhen you measure this thing, it's not massive. It doesn't create massive value for the company. It did require a fair amount\nof operational complexity to ship all these Squares to people and figure out how to get them, etc, etc. But it allowed him to\nbe excited about his job and to learn how to filter future ideas. So it was totally worth letting him make the \u201cMistake.\"\nThe next and most important thing you do is edit the team. So these are the people you work with. Nobody is going to\nhave a perfect team and you certainly aren't going to start that way. So what I am going to try to do is maximize the\nprobability of success in editing the team. So I like this idea of barrels and ammunition. Most companies, when they get\ninto hiring mode, as Sam pointed out you should defer that a bit, but when you do just hire a lot of people, you expect that\nwhen you add more people your horsepower or your velocity of shipping things is going to increase. Turns out it doesn't\nwork that way. When you hire more engineers you don't get that much more done. You actually sometimes get less done.\nYou hire more designers, you definitely don't get more done, you get less done in a day.\nThe reason why is because most great people actually are ammunition. But what you need in your company are barrels.\nAnd you can only shoot through the unique barrels that you have. That's how the velocity of your company improves is\nhaving barrels. Then you stock them with ammunition, then you can do a lot. You go from one barrel company, which is\nmostly how you start, to a two barrel company and you get twice as many things done in a day, per week, per quarter. If\nyou go to three barrels, great. If you go to four barrels, awesome. Barrels are very difficult to find. But when you have\nthem, give them lots of equity. Promote them, take them to dinner every week, because they are virtually irreplaceable\nbecause they are also very culturally specific. So a barrel at one company may not be a barrel at another company.\nOne of the ways, the definition of a barrel is, they can take an idea from conception and take it all the way to shipping and\nbring people with them. And that's a very cultural skill set. Two questions are probably occurring to you. How can you tell\nwho is a barrel and who is not? One is you start with a very small set of responsibilities, it can be very trivial. It can be\nsomething like, I want to reward the engineers in my office at nine o'clock every night with a nice cold, fresh smoothie.\nThis is actually a real example. I was frustrated, our engineers were working really hard, and maybe 20%, 30% would\nstay late in the evening and we had already served them dinner but I wanted to give them something cool to reward them.\nYou can think about alcohol but that's a little complicated. So smoothies were probably a little bit better than pizza, which\ndrains you of energy. But nobody could get smoothies to show up in my office at nine o'clock sharp, that were cold, that\ntasted good, and that were delivered in the right place that the engineers would find them.\nYou would think this is simple but in fact it took two months to get this done. So we had an intern start, and I think on his\nsecond day I was explaining this problem, and he said, well I will do it. And I was looking at him like there was no way. I\nhave seen my office manager fail, my assistant fail, who were actually pretty good. This just isn't going to happen. And\nlow and behold they show up.

And it will break, everybody, I couldn't run the world, everybody has some level of\ncomplexity that they can handle. And what you want to do is keep expanding it until you see where it breaks and that's the\nrole they should stay in. That level of sophistication. But some people will surprise you. There will be some people that\nyou do not expect. With different backgrounds, without a lot of experience that can just handle enormously complicated\ntasks. So keep testing that and pushing the envelope. The other signal to look for is once you've hired someone, with an\nopen office, just watch who goes up to other people's desks. Particularly people they don't report to. If someone keeps\ngoing to some individual employees desk and they don't report them, it's a sign that they believe that person can help\nthem. So if you see that consistently, those are your barrels. Just promote them, give them as much opportunity as you\ncan.\nThe other question everybody asks about people is when do you hire somebody above somebody. And when do you\nmentor somebody, and when do you replace somebody? And the way to think about this is that every company has their\nown growth rate, and every individual has their own growth rate.

LinkedIn was always a very linear company, it never went like this. So for example I joined LInkedIn 18 months\nafter we launched and we only had 1.5 million users. Which for a social product is a very small number. And when I\njoined I was the twenty-seventh employee, and when I left two and a half years later they only had fifty-seven employees.\nIn contrast, when I joined Square as the twentieth employee, two and a half years later we had two hundred fifty-three\nemployees.\nSo each company has it's own velocity on this curve. So if the company is going like this, you can only keep people on\nthe roles if their own learning curve is going like this. On the other hand, if your learning curve is like this, anyone learning\nfaster than that, you can give them the same roles as they do. So always track the individual slope of employee and the\ncompany growth rate. Now that you have your barrels figured out, and you can identify people who can take ideas that\nyou have in the back of your head, scope it out, run with it, ship it, and it's perfect. Where do you aim these barrels?\nSo I am going to argue that you need to spend a lot of time focusing on people. This is something I learned from Peter\nThiel actually. He used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing. And we all rebelled,\nevery single person in the company rebelled to this idea. Because it's so unnatural, it's so different than other companies\nwhere people wanted to do multiple things, especially as you get more senior, you definitely want to do more things and\nyou feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing.\nPeter would enforce this pretty strictly. He would say, I will not talk to you about anything else besides than this one thing I\nassigned you. I don't want to hear about how great you are doing over here, just shut up, and Peter would run away. And\nthen focus until you conquer this one problem. And the insight behind this is that most people will solve problems that\nthey understand how to solve. Roughly speaking, they will solve B+ problems instead of A+ problems. A+ problems are\nhigh impact problems for your company but they are difficult. You don't wake up in the morning with a solution, so you\ntend to procrastinate them. So imagine you wake up in the morning and create a list of things to do today, there's usually\nthe A+ one on the top of the list, but you never get around to it. And so you solve the second and third. Then you have a\ncompany of over a hundred people so it cascades. You have a company that is always solving B+ things which does\nmean you grow, which does mean you add value, but you never really create that breakthrough idea. No one is spending\n100% of their time banging their head against the wall every day until they solve it. So I highly recommend some version\nof that. You can be less stringent, you can give people three things to work on, but I would still track the concept of what\nwould happen if you only gave everybody one thing to prioritize.\nYou don't want to be making all these decisions yourself. You have to create tools that enable people to make decisions\nat the same level you would make them yourself. So how do you create scale and leverage? The first thing I would\nrecommend is to build a dashboard. This is an old Square dashboard, it looks pretty presentable even today. The\nconstruct of the dashboard should be drafted by the founder. You need to simplify the value proposition in the company's\nmetrics for success on a whiteboard. You can have other people build the dashboard, I don't care about that. But you\nneed to draw it out. Like what does business success look to us and key inputs to those and then have someone create\nsomething that is very intuitive for every single person in the company, including customer support to use. And then, the\nkey metric of whether you succeed is what fraction of your employees use that dashboard every day? If it's actually useful,\nit should be close to 100%. It's not going to be probably 100% but you want to measure that. Just like you have quality\nscores for your other KPI\u2019s with users, your dashboard needs to be as intuitive as your product is for users.\nAnother concept is transparency.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4230, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1a0073b-0387-4cbb-9590-a1cc3c5595a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1a0073b-0387-4cbb-9590-a1cc3c5595a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "79be540e-5ab3-444f-8071-3be5a947b9f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e06c7737b44fa590a99ecdf5bf7d7f664b9ce72b4369fc62699a76530b422f7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32105b41-b2ba-4c35-aca5-9d8bff94e7b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "0a6cfb9614f320f8d71338ab87517957aa7a5dcb3bfccb0a9f8b58d84babf412", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "25330bdf-7a3a-47cb-9430-286c23767a7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfb6ff127a70c2b31cc55bf12782bd32bf7671c16aa2bbabaf592d1e05a16b90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9ebc6f9fd3fa73e7d8356baef520b785e8ccc99fc2428b1be986d5ab1304eeb3", "text": "The\nconstruct of the dashboard should be drafted by the founder.

Transparency people talk a lot about, it's a goal everybody ascribes to but when push\ncomes to shove, very few people actually adhere to it. So let me walk through a little bit of transparency and different\nstages of transparency. Metrics are the first step. So everyone in your company should have access to what's going on.\nOther things I like to do, is to take your board decks. As you get more formal, the board decks will get more complicated.\nAnd actually review every single slide with every single employee after the board meeting. You can strip out the\ncompensation information if you really want to. But every other slide you should go through with every single employee\nand explain it. If you can remember some of the feedback you got from your board that is really cool to pass on.\nAnother thing we did at Square is when we scaled, not everybody is going to get invited to every meeting, but they are\ngoing to want to go to every meeting. The way you scale that is you create notes for every meeting and you send them to\nthe entire company. So we created notes at least for every single meeting that involved more than two people, somebody\nwould write notes and send it to the entire company. So everyone felt that as the company added employees, they", "start_char_idx": 3363, "end_char_idx": 5494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25330bdf-7a3a-47cb-9430-286c23767a7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "25330bdf-7a3a-47cb-9430-286c23767a7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9dcc3ef7-5acb-4c72-a9f4-955735be7f41", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "bc35cf08c8f528dbd5d851007a29252de5534974fd17d9387b6f020a2a1ef9de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1a0073b-0387-4cbb-9590-a1cc3c5595a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "9ebc6f9fd3fa73e7d8356baef520b785e8ccc99fc2428b1be986d5ab1304eeb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf7f43f7-dddb-43a5-a1aa-8dd55e5c2503", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ecfd5b06a9e3adcc8544452df18d45fb45d6275ab7695ef8419252114ce11fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dfb6ff127a70c2b31cc55bf12782bd32bf7671c16aa2bbabaf592d1e05a16b90", "text": "continued to track what was interesting, what was going on. And they never felt excluded, hopefully. Another thing is,\neven details around conference rooms. Every conference room at Square has glass walls. Because as soon as you have\nregular walls, people wonder what's going on. It's amazing, if they can see who exactly is in the meeting and who is\nmeeting with who when, they don't start to worry nearly as much as about what's going on behind those closed doors.\nStripe, you may have seen a blog post about, I think Patrick wrote it, about email transparency, about actually allowing\neveryone to have access to email. That's pretty far out there but it has certain merits to it. I would call all the tactics you\nhear and read about as minimal viable transparency. I actually think you could push the envelope a lot more. Steve Jobs\nactually tried this at Next, he actually tried transparent compensation. I actually think that even though Next didn't do\nextremely well, the real reason wasn't around experimenting with compensation in transparency. There is a lot of merit to\nthat. The critique of compensation transparency is, well we want people to be teammates and work together and\ncollaborate. And if you look in the sports world where people are teammates and collaborate, all of their compensation is\nactually public. In fact, any one of us can look up one of their compensations in the sports world to get it exactly accurate.\nAnd somehow it seems to work. So I am not completely bought into that you need to keep compensation non-transparent.\nAnd finally, metrics. So you want to measure things. You want to measure outputs, not inputs. And again, you should\ndictate this yourself. You should draft the dashboard yourself to tie this all together. One important concept is pairing\nindicators. Which is, if you measure one thing and only one thing, the company tends not to optimize to that. And often at\nthe expense of something that is important. Cost is example of payments and financial services is risk. It's really easy to\ngive the risk team the objective and say, we want to lower our fraud rate. It sounds great. Until they start treating every\nuser in this audience as a suspect because they want to lower the fraud rate. So they require each of you to call them up\non the phone and give them more supplemental information and fax in things. Then you have the lowest fraud rate in the\nworld, you also have the lowest level of customer satisfaction score.\nWhat you want to measure at the same rate as your fraud rate, is your false positive rate. That forces the team to actually\ninnovate. Similarly, you can give recruiters metrics around hiring. And guess what? You will have a lot of people come in\nfor interviews. But if you are not tracking the quality of interviewers, you may be very unhappy about the quality of people\nyou are hiring and giving interviews to. So you always want to create the opposite and measure both. And the people\nresponsible for that team need to be measured on both.\nFinally around metrics. One insight I have had over my career is what you, you kind of want to look for the anomalies. You\ndon't actually want to look for the expected behavior. So a famous example was at PayPal. None of the top ten markets\nthat the company was planning on going after included eBay. One day, someone noticed that 54 of the sellers actually\nhandwritten into their eBay listings, please pay me with Paypal and brought this to the attention of the executive team at\nthe time. The first reaction from the executive team was, what the hell is going on? Let's get them out of the system, that is\nnot the focus. Fortunately, David Sacks came back the next day and said, I think we found our market. Let's actually build\ntools for these power sellers instead of forcing them to write into their listing, pay me with PayPal. Why don't we just have\nan HTML button that they can just insert? And that actually worked. Then he thought, why should we have them insert it\neach time? Why don't we just automatically insert it for them?

It was in\nthe settings, you had to go to the margin and find a link. It was 25-35% of every click at scale, so this is just invalid stuff.\nAnd it made no sense whatsoever. I had never seen UI perform that way.\nI went around for weeks trying to figure this out, then someone smart, actually it was Max Levchin, said something to me\nand I was like, he was like, it's vanity. I was like, ah ha! People are looking at themselves in the mirror. Thats a very good\nanswer, because they weren't editing their profile. Nobody has something to edit everyday in their profile. But they were\njust looking at themselves in the mirror every day because it made them feel good. Then you could test that with, if I had\nmore content would I look at myself in the mirror more often? It turns out, you did. If you had more endorsements would\nyou look at yourself more in the mirror? You did. So we figured out what was underneath the utilitarian product, the\nproduct the team thought they were building was actually more emotional vanity. It didn't actually translate to the best\nfeature like the Paypal example. We couldn't exactly put a button up that said, be more vain today on the homepage. That\nprobably would not work perfectly.

And we wouldn't have found that if we hadn't looked through anomalous data.\nThe final topic I want to talk about is details. And in my assigned reading there is a great book by Bill Walsh, called The\nScore Takes Care of Itself. And the basic point of the book is that if you get all the details right, you don't worry about how\nto build a billion dollar business, you don't worry about how to have a billion dollars in revenue, you don't worry about\nhaving a billion users. Thats a byproduct of what you do everyday to get the details excellent. So the topics that he talks\nabout in the book that really resonated with me was, he took over the 49ers in 1979. They were the worse team in\nfootball, I believe they were 2 in 14 which is really bad if you don't know football. In the next ten years he transformed the\nteam into NFL\u2019s best, won three super bowls. And what's the first thing he did to go from the worse team to one of the best\nin many ways? He actually taught the receptionist to answer the phone properly. He wrote a three page memo on how to\nanswer the phone.\nAnd that may sound absurd but what his point was organization as a whole does everything exactly the right way. Then\nreceivers will start running their routes at 7 yards not 8 yards. And that actually will matter. And if every person on the\nteam executes to the same level of performance, you will have a team that is performing at the highest possible level. And\nat the highest performance level, the team will play at their best. So how to relate this to a company may include a lot of\ndetails that do not matter, not seem that they matter superficially. Most people would agree that details matter when faced\nwith the user. But what the real debate it is on things that don't face the use. Steve Jobs famously in the Mac, insisted\nupon an immaculate circuit board, you can read about this in various books. The Mac, for those of you who don't\nremember the Mac. Maybe most of you here, but may have seen it. It couldn't be opened. So the circuit board couldn't be\nseen by any person in the world. There was no way to open the Mac except by the people that worked at Apple.\nSteve insisted that it be absolutely perfect and beautiful. That is the sort of detail obsession that building this sort of\ncompany requires. Examples that may be a bit more practical for you instead of circuit boards may be, what sort of foods\ndo you serve people? It actually matters more than you might guess. When people don't like the food you serve them,\nwhat do they do? They go gossip, they go complain to their friends, they walk over to someones desk. Then all of a\nsudden that lunch that they are complaining about is what they are spending most of their time gossiping and\ncomplaining instead of brainstorming. You don't have this serendipities idea matching another serendipities idea that\ncreates a spark instead they are all wallowing and whittling around. The best thing you can do is give people the food\nthey want or the food thats good for them that makes them more productive. So it may seem like this glorious job you\nthought you had is more like running around being a TaskRabbit for people. But it is to take things off their plate that is a\ndistraction so they can be high performance machines. And if you take enough things away from people to distract them\nand give them the tools to be successful, all of a sudden your organization produces a lot more.\nSimilarly, often one that people get wrong is office space. So one natural thing is when you need an office to have an\noffice manager of your team go out and find offices. And they will go out and come back with photos and ideas. You need\nto do that yourself. The office environment that people work in everyday dictates the culture that you are going to be in.\nAnd the final thing, then I am going to take some questions, is around effort.\nUltimately I don't believe you can create a company without a lot of effort and that you need to lead by example.

How Steve did it at Next was there was a high band and a low\nband. You either had a lot of experience or a low experience and that was it. So low band, now would be about $85,000\nflat.

This is just a default everybody has. Five years ago it was a benefit to get people high powered\nmachines as opposed to optimizing our cost by having Dell Machines and ugly monitors, just as an example. If you think\nabout all these people who are relentlessly resourceful and equally talented in a mass competitive ecosystem competing\nfor talent, you learn to give people the best possible tools to do the best possible job. So rigorously asking, how do I make\npeople more successful, what things do they not need to be working on, or distracting. And what things can I give them to\nmake them more valuable per day? Then just break that down per day and solve that stuff yourself.\nQ: When you are in a startup environment, resources are scarce. How do you optimize for those things?\nA: That's a good question. First of all I think you must have your own office. I don't believe ever in shared office spaces.\nPeter talks a little about this, that every good startup is a cult. And it's really hard to create a cult if you are sharing space\nwith people. Because a cult means you think you are better than every other startup, you have a special way of doing\nthings that's better than anyone else in the world. And if you are sharing physical space with others it's very hard to\ninternalize that. So I would start there. But it is a prioritization question. Everywhere is scarce, so it's just a question of the\nmagnitude of zeros you are paying attention to. Probably not $10 expenditure, but $100, $1000, $10,000, then $1 million\nstarts being a rounding error.\nSo I would figure out is what is the most important, a quality office that creates a good vibe that allows you to recruit\npeople. Because recruits are very savvy about this. They walk into your office and they can tell a lot about the culture\ninstantly. I can walk into a company office and I can tell whether or not I am going to invest as soon as I walk in. Seriously,\nI just absolutely rule things out that I don't want to invest in as soon as I walk in. And there's times I walk in an office, like\nwow this is really impressive. You can tell how people work together, how hard they are working, how distracted they are.\nRoelof Botha at Sequoia made a point to me about YouTube. So when I invested in YouTube in the very very beginning,\nit wasn't obviously going to be successful. Then Roelof led this series A Investment for this client on YouTube and we\nwere at a board meeting together and he said, I really think Youtube is going to work. I said, Why? And he said, every\ntime I go to one of my portfolios companies half the office is watching Youtube during their lunch. I was like, really good\nsign. And so you pick up on these little things and you can predict a lot.\nA: What do you think is the best way of getting street credit as a new manager?\nQ: Oh boy. Almost all good managers in Silicon Valley are promoted because of their individual performance. In cultures\nthat are bureaucratic the percentage is even higher. So we tried in PayPal to only promote people who were kicking ass\nat their discipline. Peter didn't believe in general managers. In fact I remember going for a job around campus with him\nmy first week of PayPal. He was asking me how things were going, other kinds of CEO questions. Then we got in this\ndebate about whether the company needed any more managers. He was like, nope. No managers. We are only going to\npromote people, so the VP in engineering is going to be the single best engineer. The VP of design is going to be the\nsingle best designer. The VP of product, is going to be the single best product person. And they are going to learn to\nmanage later. The advantage of that is you don't demoralize people. Because everyone knows their boss is actually\nbetter at their job than they are. And they can learn stuff.

But people, some things you just have to learn by doing. Some people can\u2019t\nlearn to play the guitar by reading a book. You have to actually try to manage a bit and you won't do well at first. I have\nanother set of tactics and classes on what you actually do when you transition from an individual to a manager. It's hard.\nOne of the first things people don't get right right away is their timing allocation. Actually, what I would recommend is\ndoing what I call a calendar audit.

Another part that is hardly ever, look at your recruiting\nwebsite. It almost never has the same quality as your conversion funnel. I would look at customer support. Another classic\narea that is never up to the same quality. Treat customer support as a product so you actually have an engineering team\nand a design team that over time focuses on making that world class. Usually we have other executives at a scaled\ncompany. Most executives were trained differently at other companies and bring that with them. You have to crosstrain\nthat. So if you hired a VP of engineering of Google its very different than a Design Leader from Apple. They don't actually\nlearn anything the same way. So you are going to have to stitch that together some how. Either one or the other is going\nto have to learn the other style. Or you are going to have to create your own style and really teach that to your executives.\nSo it shows up all the time. All you have to do is pick up the company's products and look for things that have a different\nvoice and you can see it, visual voice, word choice, all over the map.\nSam Altman: Can you talk a little about the tactics of how you manage people? How often do you meet with them?\nA: So the canonical advice sounds obvious but was radical back in 1982 when Andy wrote his book, is to have a one on\none roughly every two weeks. Some people say every week, but I wouldn't go longer than two weeks. Every week can be\nideal in many companies. The reason why there is another adage, you should only have five to seven direct reports. That\nactually derives on the concept of having a one on one every week. The director reports is so you can fit enough one on\nones in your calendar a week and get other things done. I think one on ones once a week is ideal. I think the agenda\nshould be crafted by the employee that reports the manager, not the manager. The one on one is mostly to benefit the\nemployee. They should walk in with, these are the three things I want to talk about. Even bullet points in advance by\nemail so you have time to chew on it, and you're not on the fly winging your answers. But that's probably the best\nstructure. But if someone is really good and been doing this a long time and has internal credibility you might push out\nthe one every week to once every two weeks. Maybe every month. I don't know that I would go beyond once a month\never.\nQ: When is it acceptable to compromise and hire someone that is ammunition instead of someone who is barrel?\nA: Truthfully you are going to hire more ammunition, naturally, than barrels. So there is a ratio between the two. The\nquestion is the ratio. At some point the ratio is going to get out of whack, you will have only one barrel in the company and\nfifty engineers. You might as well have ten engineers because you are not going to get any work done. You are just\nwasting resources. You are going to frustrate engineers because everyone is going to need your approval. Your signoff.\nYour editing. It's just going to stack and get frustrating to people. I think roughly one, to ten, to twenty is the right range.\nYou don't need more engineers until you have more barrels. Designers are a little different. But you are always going to\nbe hiring more ammunition than barrels. A good barrel will have a feel for that. One way to correct for this is, there is this\nnatural tendency to create headcount on your team. Like an empire building tendency. Like I manage twenty people and\nSam only manages ten and you manage three. So I'm more important than Sam. And Sam is more important than you.\nPut an X here, over Y which equals the output, and specify how many things they have done successfully and then divide\nby the number of people on their team.

That's the default. Obviously there\nare inflection moments when things go right or wrong and then it's on an ad hoc basis. Actually right now I do a lot by text\nmessage.

But I try in person meetings every two weeks.\nQ: ?\nA: No. Being a venture capitalist to me is like being more of a psychologist. So if you come to my office we have two\nchairs with a table in the middle. And we sit down and it's like, Tell me your problems. My response is usually, have you\nthought about this?

Sam talked a little about this in his lecture. So a company will move\nrecruiting first, second, or third. Somewhere in that spectrum. If it's your number one priority then 25% is probably a good\nallocation. Actually I like the calendar audit more for CEOs even moreso than new managers. So when I work with CEOs\nthat aren't thriving in that role for the first time, I actually force them to show my their calendar. Now I am going to ruin this\ntrick. But I ask them to write them out on paper and specify whatever they are. Then I ask them to pull out their calendar\nand see if it matches. And it never matches. Never. Recruiting is the one that is usually the most often awry. Half the\nCEOs will say recruiting is their number one priority. It's almost never the biggest block of time on anyone's calendar. So\nthat is what you are trying to do is match resources to priorities in the calendar audit. And there is no software that does\nthis really well for you. It would be great, right now we pull up someone's Google calendar and hand count up the hours.\nWhich is insane. But that is the best way, just ask about their priorities. Priorities are raising money, you don't want to\nallocate most of your time recruiting. One more question.\nQ: On the surface some of this advice is contradictory. How do you harmonize those roles?\nA: It's a good question. How do you harmonize when details really matter, but you've got that one thing to do, you want to\nonly allocate time to those one, two, or three things. How do you put those things together? There is some tension even in\na healthy organization. There is some tension of why are we focused on writing the script as opposed to something the\nuser may see.\nThe underlying philosophy of getting the details right is pretty important to install in the very very beginning of a company.\nBecause people will start acting that way and making decisions that way themselves. So you won't have to literally do\nthat. If you have to actually do that then that shows the foundation isn't that solid. When you first start the company it's\nabout getting the details right. Everyone is precise, everyone on every task is always thinking that way. And then that\nscales, the people you bring in will think that way, the people that think that way will tend to get hired and those who can\u2019t\nwont get hired. Each team and each leader will tend to enforce that themselves. So the CEO is almost never doing it. So\nit's partially how do you start. And the key to culture is it's a framework for making decisions. And if it's baked into your\nculture, people learn how to make decisions across that culture without you ever saying anything. You never have to\nreally do anything except watch and promote and move people around.\nCool.

So\nthat book was entirely too long.\"\nI didn't actually have time to collapse the three hundred pages into fifty minutes. Like Mark Twain, I didn't have time to\nwrite a good short letter, so I'm going to write a long letter. But in this case, I am going to teach exactly one management\nconcept.\nI see CEO's mess up this one management concept more consistently than anything else. From when they're very, very\nearly to when they're very, very big as a company. It's the easiest thing to say and the most difficult to master. The concept\nin musical form is from Sly and the Family Stone. \"Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong. My beliefs are in my song. No\ndifference what group I'm in.\"\nThat's the musical version of today's lesson. For those of you who are musical, you can leave now.\nWhen you're making a critical decision, you have to understand how it's going to be interpreted from all points of view.\nNot just your point of view and not just the person you're talking to but the people who aren't in the room, everybody else.\nIn other words, you have to be able, when making critical decisions, to see the decision through the eyes of the company\nas a whole. You have to add up every employee's view and then incorporate that into your own view. Otherwise your\nmanagement decisions are going to have weird side effects and potentially dangerous consequences. It's a hard thing to\ndo because at the point when you are making a decision, you're often under a great deal of pressure.\nLet's get into the agenda. I am going to cover four cases. First, I am going to cover demotions, which are very emotional.\nThen raises, which are also emotional. Then we are going to evaluate one of Sam's blog posts, which is news to Sam. I\nfigured I'd tease him since he invited me to do a fifty minute management class after I wrote a three hundred page book.\nThen I'm going to talk about history's greatest practitioner at this, I'm wearing a shirt with him on it, and how he used it to\ndo something that nobody had ever done and has ever done since in human history. Basically complete mastery of the\ntechnique I am going to talk about.\nSo, first business example, you've got an executive, and do you demote or do you fire him? This comes from an actual\nconversation, an actual real life situation that I was working on with a CEO. The basic situation was this: he had a great\nexecutive he had hired. He was working harder than anybody else in the company and was doing everything he was\nsupposed to. Everybody liked him because he worked so hard and was a generally a smart person, but he was in over\nhis head knowledge-wise. He did not have the knowledge and the skills to do what the company needed him to do or\nreally compete against the competition. So he couldn't actually keep him in the job, but he was a great guy. So the\nquestion is, should I fire this person or can I just move him into a lower role and bring in a person above him. That would\nbe cool. Let's look at how you make that decision.\nYou are, in this case, the CEO. It's really hard if somebody comes to work every day at six AM, is working until ten PM,\nand is working harder than anybody in the company. It's really hard to just say, \"Well sorry, nice effort but you don't get an\nA for an effort. You get an F because I fired you.\"\nNobody wants to have that conversation. A demotion is kind of neat because from a CEO's point of view, he can keep him\nin the company. He works so hard. He's a great example of somebody who gives great effort. He's got a lot of friends in\nthe company, so from a cultural stand point it's a win/win because he gets to stay. Then I can bring in somebody who can\nsolve my problem but I don't have to create another problem.\nLecture 15: How to Manage\nB Horowitz", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3977, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "927ab009-2e8b-4255-812c-bd80ea753202": {"__data__": {"id_": "927ab009-2e8b-4255-812c-bd80ea753202", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d1e756ef-277c-4dc1-9755-2f0399a65a6d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "134", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "f4fbed11af48fddd2be4b66c1fa6c592443d7ce25b2ee4be40da65e3b4a36125", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "34c0056f-27ae-4269-b4cb-dfc967b56b44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "0229af47e2c47316698f2a65dc6fb63a7d1123e158580360e7ebbf506cc458c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b81488d-9fb0-479c-9ebc-cfc06592d64e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c00bfeabf820e0ff65ea23a7e317df2be60a181d1edc7ebb5680248e8df263f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e38314dff53d44e260cf92d1a09695869cc4c5e8c57bc18dfdf9f611f150a815", "text": "If you think about it from the executive's perspective, it's like, \"I don't want to be demoted but I really don't want to be fired\nbecause if I get fired, that\u2019s a way harder more complicated thing to explain to my next employer that I got demoted.\nGetting demoted is, well I didn't really get demoted. I got a new job, a smaller title.\"\nThe last thing it enables, theoretically: the company values all of our employees. We brought you in. We made a\ncommitment to you as an employee and it will enable you to keep growing with the company. This was the conversation I\nwas having with the CEO and I said, \u201cWell, wait a minute. Let me ask you this. What's the equity package that this\nexecutive has?\" He goes, \u201cWell, what do you mean?\" I was like, \u201cWell I would like to see direct level of compensation?\nDoes he get a Vice President level of compensation? Does he have 1.5%? Does he have 0.4%?\"\nThat gave the CEO pause. He's like, \u201cWell, he does have 1.5% of the fully-diluted equity of the company.\" And I was like,\n\u201cOk. So you're an engineer in your company. How do you feel about somebody who used to be the head of sales who\nbrought in with 1.5%? What do your engineers get? Do they get 0.1% of the company? 0.2%? What are they getting at\nthis point? How are they going to feel about somebody who is NOT the Head of Sales with one point five percent of the\ncompany?\" And he was like, \" Uh oh.\" And I was like, \u201cYeah! Uh oh. Because how fair is that? Are you going to take the\nequity away? Are you up to do that? Are you up to go back and take back his compensation? How productive do you\nthink he'll be if you take away his compensation? Secondly, will people give him the same respect now that you've\ndemoted him? Because they knew him as this and now he's that. \"I knew you when you were Head of Sales now you're\nthe Regional Manager and you're telling me what the f\n*\n to do? You're telling me I need to make that call? It seems to me\nyou got demoted. Who are you to talk to me? I am the up and comer. I am going to be the next VP of Sales at the\ncompany.\"\nAll these things come into play. When you look at the end, you may think you are dealing with one person. You may think\nthat this is a demotion or a firing of one person. What does it mean according to that one person? But what you are really\ndoing is saying, what does it mean to fail on the job? Particularly the highest paid, the highest compensated job in the\ncompany from an equity standpoint. And then, what's required to maintain your equity? Is it good enough to put in an\neffort or do you have to get a result? In different situations at different levels, the answers will be different.

You can say it is highly confidential that I am giving you this raise.

Talk to any experienced CEO and they will tell you this is true. If you give out raises when people just\nask you for them, you will have a lot of people asking you for raises. That is called encouraging behavior.\nWhat do you do? The right answer is you have to be formal to save your own culture.

I don't want a lot of process.\nI want it to be organic. We want to do yoga. We want to only smoke organic weed.\" Sorry that was a Peter Thiel kind of\nway.

There is one process and that's it.\nWhen I used to be CEO and I had executives, the bigger you become the harder this gets because the more aggressive\nthe people working for you are.

I got your input going in. I got everybody\nelse's input.

Is this a policy that all startups should adopt? Let me first explain again what the policy is. Currently, the\nway almost every stock option package in startup world is this: you get stock that vests over a period of time. When you\nleave you have, and it depends on the company, 90 days. If you do not buy your stock in that period, it's gone! It's not\nyours anymore. Which, depending on when you entered the company, could be a big problem. A lot of companies today\nthat have a high valuation, like an Airbnb or an Uber, when they bring you in they go \u201cWow, if you look at your 409A price\ncompared to the preferred price, the stock we're giving you right now, the options are already worth 10 million dollars.\"\nAnd you're like\" Woooo! 10 million dollars. I'm rich.\"\nWhat they don't necessarily tell you is in order for you to get that money, because the preferred is worth 10 million dollars,\nyour options are probably going to cost you 2.5 million dollars when you leave. If you don't have that 2.5 million dollars in\n90 days, it's gone! You just lost all your money. So Sam is like, wow! That's fucked up! And so he wrote a blog post and he\nsaid everybody should change it.\nThe first question that you have to ask yourself is, \"This has kind of been around since the 80's, so why has a rule like this\nbeen around for 30 years?\" It turned out, Sam, I don't know whether he figured this out or just intuited it, but he was right.\nSomething actually had changed. Up until 2004, there used to be a law called APB Opinion Number 25. That law was the\nold way to account for stock options. It's also the law that all the guys went to jail on. I know a lot of people who caught a\ncase on APB 25, so I'm glad it's gone. It's a very confusing law. A lot people did not understand it and they literally went to\njail.\nWhen that was a law, if you gave somebody 10 years to exercise their options, you would never have been able to go\npublic and you would never have been able to be acquired because you were taking an expense that was tied to your\nstock price. The more your stock went up, the more compensation expense you'd have to take. The worst thing is you\nwouldn't know what it was going to be. It was totally unpredictable, so you could never forecast earnings. Ever! Because\nyour earnings would be a function of your stock price. The more your stock price went up, the more money you would\nlose. In those days, people did not look through stock option expenses. It just wasn't doable. That's why everybody's\nagreement was written at 90 days. That's why it's there. So absolutely it's the right thing to question it being there. Are you\nguys following? You get this? This is more complicated than the first two examples, but it's a very important one.\nYour perspective on this, if you have employees, is you want to be fair. Nobody wants to say to a hire,\"Hey you got all this\nstock in 4 years... SIKE!\" Especially when you fire someone. \"Hey you're fired! I feel real bad about it BUT guess what?\nYou know, I am also going to take all your money too!\"\nThat's a problem. This is the thing that you have to keep in mind, you have to think about the people who are staying and\nyou want to reward the people who are staying. The perspective of the Employee who leaves, and this is really critical\nbecause this is your reputation, is I worked a year, where's my years pay? Now you're telling me about this 90 day\nexercise? I know it was in the small print of my stock option agreement but my Hiring Manager never told me about that.\nThey never told me I was going to need 2 million dollars to get my stock. Which I don't have. So if I was rich I'd get my\nstock? That's not fair. So now I am fired and then I'm screwed. Guess what?

If that person leaves they're going to go \" Well, should I leave too? What did they get and how does that\ncompare to my deal?\"\nIf we look at the situation and analyze it, there are a lot of components. First, companies tread a lot of people around here,\nthe average is somewhere around 10 percent. It's probably getting higher, particularly if you are in San Francisco just\nbecause of the culture there.

That could be good news or bad news. It could be good\nnews in that you get to keep somebody you might have lost. It could be bad news in that you kept them for the exact\nwrong reason: they have handcuffs on. You may get an Employee that is worse than not having an Employee. On the\nother hand, a 10 year option on a highly volatile security, for those of you who have taken that class, is valuable. 10 years\noption, volatility and length, that's the value of an option.\n10 years on a Startup stock, that's a valuable thing. Remember the employee who stays doesn't get that. The employee\nwho stays just gets a stock. They don't get the new job and the new stock. They get one thing but they don't get both\nthings. You have to weigh that in. This is a hard one. It should be reevaluated by every company. I wouldn't go as far as\nSam and say it should be adopted by every company. You have to think about what you want. I would offer two\nAlternative Cultural Statements. One is, we treat employees with straight forwardness. We're going to be fair and\ntherefore you get 10 years to exercise your stock. What we said we're going to give you, you\u2019re going to get regardless of\nhow rich or poor you are. That's just a done deal.\nThe second way to handle it - no companies do this, which is why I actually really like this post that he wrote - is you can\nsay up front, \" Look you are guaranteed to get your salary but for your stock to be meaningful, these are the things that\nhave to happened. You have to have vested. Two, you have to stay until we get to an exit. Untile the company makes it.\nYou've got other money.\" Finally, the company actually has to be worth something. Because 10 percent of nothing is\nnothing. The reason we set the policy this way is we really value people who stay. So don't join this company if you are\ngoing to join another one in 18 months because you're going to get screwed. Our policy guarantees you're going to get\nscrewed.\nThose are two ways to handle it. It really depends on you and how you want to run your culture. With all these things, it's\ncritical to think it through from everybody's prospective because when push comes to shove, that's going to matter. That's\ngoing to change the outcome of your company.\nSam: I am actually revising my recommendation slightly.\nBen Horowitz: Let\u2019s hear it.\nSam: No, it's that I think there needs to be more incentive to stay. If someone gets fired, I still think they get screwed a lot\nof the time.\nBen Horowitz: The other thing that's really important, that Sam pointed out, is how much money you have. If you have the\nmoney, you don't get screwed. You can buy your stock. You do take some risks, but you can buy your stock. If you don't\nhave the money, you don't have the money.\nNow we're getting to the person on my shirt: Toussaint.

To give you some numbers, over the course of slavery, somewhere like 400 years, a million slaves were brought\nto the US. At the end of slavery, there were four million slaves in the US. In that same period, in the sugar growing\ncountries in the Caribbean, two million slaves were brought over and at the end of slavery there were seven hundred\nthousand left.

That's the\nslavery that he grew up in. It's really important to understand this because to get out of that perspective was not easy. But\nhe had a vision that was threefold. One, he wanted to end slavery. Two, he wanted to actually take control of the country\nand run the country. And three, he wanted it to be a world-class country. Not one in which he had simply freed the slaves\nbut one that could compete on a worldwide basis. That was his mindset going in. What I read was the environment he\ncame from.\nA management example is conquering the enemy. The sequence of battles that occurred in Haiti were, he first had to\ndefeat the locals. Once he defeated the locals, there were several countries that were very, very interested in taking\ncontrol of Haiti. Principally Spain, England and France. He had to defeat those armies as well. When he conquered them,\nhe had to decide what to do with the conquered soldiers and the leaders on the other side. He took into perspective three\ndifferent points of view. One, his soldier\u2019s point of view. Two, his enemies point of view. And finally ,the point of view of the\nresulting culture. What kind of country was he building? The army was going to be the seed corn for the culture of the\nwhole country.\nFrom the soldier\u2019s perspective: do we get to pillage? Soldiers like to pillage. It\u2019s something for their work. The second\nthing is they're trying to kill us so we should kill them. That's a basic perspective of the people who are fighting for him, the\nmost important people to Toussaint. I put pillage up there, a couple of things to know, one I didn't put rape up there. Very\ninterestingly, not only did he not allow rape among his army, but he didn't even allow his officers to cheat on their wives. If\nthey did he would get rid of them because he was so concerned about the resulting culture. What was it going to be? Was\nit going to be productive? Was it going to be the best in world? Or was it going to be something less than that? That was\nhis mindset going in. His army was actually famous for not pillaging. They were already actually used to this. This was\none of the most surprising things to the conquered people to the point where where even the white people were very\nimpressed because he would go into their city and not pillage even though he would win. Again, this is because he took\na long view of the culture.\nThis is an important subtle point. He believed the culture of Haiti, because it was a slave culture, sugar plantation culture,\nwas pretty low grade compared to what he had experienced in Europe when he dealt with the Europeans. He thought\nthat slave culture was even more broken than Haitian culture because it's the kind of culture where, \"Oh you don't do what\nI tell you? I'm going to beat you to death. I am going to blow you up with gun powder.\" If you think about the behavior that\nensues from that, that was the culture he knew he needed to replace. He knew he needed to upgrade.\nHis solution when he conquered the British, or the Spanish, or he conquered the French, was he would take the very best\npeople from the opposing side and he would make them generals in his army. You probably didn't expect that. Here are\nthe guys trying to kill him. He's leading a slave evolution and when he conquers the enemy, he actually incorporates\nthem into his army and makes them part of it. He wanted the expertise and he wanted the culture to be at a much higher\nlevel.\nThe second question he had, this even more complicated, was what do you do with the slave owners? You're leading\nslave revolution, you take control of the country,what do you do with the slave owners? Three perspectives again. For the\nslaves, you want to kill the slave owners. There is no question. That's your land now. You won. F them. From Toussaint's\nperspective, it was more complicated because he wanted Haiti to be a first world country and sugar was really important.\nThe whole slave economy was the sugar economy.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d68d369-3fac-491d-8843-4b642f01d5ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d68d369-3fac-491d-8843-4b642f01d5ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a96a80bd-92cf-44d2-b1c7-e1a71a6eefd2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "72359cdd891b6a7b070053c2375cc8aa7477f7c950f23e08a297e804127f135a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76ca0717-9e34-4656-b4ea-25a6e243f49a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2efcddb1879b3364b618a7011cdcd0e3ee9aaa36a11c17910429c590a75c859e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81f58127-66f7-440e-8624-8c3b2f04c19a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "47453a6947da0704083a0be3ac8b8968e48d8ae7d799f023b90ed31d5d137288", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "384746d0238c4ac7d5b9f7f01bf6ce0eb6d28e7c0bcef5625c4602ec4b6c54bd", "text": "You probably didn't expect that.

But he didn't know how to run a sugar plantation and he didn't have any\nbusiness relationships for trading sugar. So what to do? If you look at the slave owner perspective, it's pretty interesting\nbecause they're coming at it - and this is the point of view that he actually had the discipline to understand - they were\ncoming from a cost structure that was predicated on slave labor. Their business didn't work without slave labor. If they had\nto pay people their cash flow wouldn't work. They paid a lot of money for the slaves up front and they paid a lot of money\nfor the land. In their mind, that was how business worked. You can't just change the economics and have it still work.\nThey knew they had some power because of the position they were in.\nSo what was the answer for the slave owners?

But the bigger goal was he\nwanted a stronger culture. The way he treated those slave owners, the need to keep the economy going was important.\nLet's look at the results. First of all, Toussaint's revolution is the only successful slave revolution in the history of mankind.\nThere has never been another one and, hopefully we won't have slavery in a big way, there won't be another one. He's it.\nTwo, the plantation owners kept their land. Three he defeated Napoleon. He had a booming economy and a world class\nculture. Under Toussaint, Haiti had more export revenue than the United States. That's how successful he was in the\nrevolution. This is the power of looking at a situation not just from your point of view, but from the point of view of all the\nconstituents. Even the people you hate. Which is hard to do when you are a CEO and harder to do when you are leading\nthe revolution.\nIn conclusion, the most important thing that you can learn, and one of the hardest things to do, is you have to discipline\nyourself to see your company through the eyes of the employees, through the eyes of your partners, through the eyes of\nthe people you are not talking to and who are not in the room.\nThank you.\nNow I will take questions.\nQ: If you have to fire or demote an executive, how do you have the conversation and then how do you explain it to\neveryone else?\nBen Horowitz: Right, this is great question. Clearly it's some kind of failure. You failed on hiring. You failed on integrating.\nThey failed at their job. The first thing when firing the person is to really try to be honest. You're feeling like you failed.\nCommon reactions are, you suck and so I am firing you. Screw off. That's not good because it's not really true. You may\nbe feeling that way. Another common mistake is to be too mushy. It's not you it's me. This feels like a weird break up with\nan ex-boyfriend that you really didn't like.\nGenerally when you hire people, you try to hire the very best. You hire people who are qualified to do the job. The reason\nthey fail on the job is you made some mistake in the hiring process and you didn't match them to the needs of your\ncompany accurately enough. That's the number one reason why this fails and so that's generally a good place to start. To\nsay look, here's how we are and here's what I didn't recognize about us and about you when I made the decision. It is\nwhat it is. We're going to have to move on.\nWhen you talk to the Employees about it, it's different. You can take somebody's job, you have to take their job, but you\ndon't to take their dignity. This is something Bill Campbell taught me. It's not necessary to get up in front of the company\nand say, \"I blew that mother fucker out. I capped his ass.\"\nIn fact it's not good. Nobody feels good about that.You might feel proud of yourself but nobody else feels good about that.\nThe right thing to do is thank them for their work. Like let people know that they're moving on. You don't have to explain all\ntheir personal details. It's more important to leave them with their dignity and let them go on to live another day. What you\nsay at that meeting is their reputation, because everybody in your company is going to call on that person when they try\nand get their next job. If you start saying a bunch of BS about them, that's not going to be good and it's not going get\ninterpreted as we screwed up, it's going get interpreted as he screwed up. You have to be very honest with them but you\nhave to make sure you preserve their dignity when you talk to the company.\nQ: I was reading your book yesterday. How did you deal with all the stress?

You have to show them a better way, as a leader, if somebody's\nyour enemy and you need to convert them. This happens in business too. Somebody is a competitor and you want to\nbring them over but you don't want to bring in, ethically, people who switch from one competitor to another. Your culture\nhas to be elevated, your mission has to be elevated. Your way of doing things has to be just better. That was what was so\ncompelling for the rest of the army.\nQ: I am curious to learn how you have built a culture around people and among the entrepreneurs that you work with that\nhas differentiated you in the market from all the other venture capital firms.\nBen Horowitz: Probably not the best question for me. I can ask Sam that. I don't know. The question is how we do build a\nculture out at Andreessen Horowitz that is differentiated us from all other VC's. I feel like that is certainly the goal. We\nhave been around for 5 years now. The attempt that we made, it's for the rest of the world to judge if we succeeded, was\nthis: in the old days of VCs, when I was a entrepreneur, the basic idea was you have an entrepreneur or inventor and\nthey get a company to a point and at that point they either are ready to be CEO or you would go find a CEO to replace\nthem and build \"the company.\" Our cultural philosophy is that the founder and inventor are special. We're going to design\nthe firm and the culture of the firm to help the founder develop into a CEO. We do a lot of systematic things different. The\ntwo biggest are all of our partners are founders or CEOs. It's an original model where some sort of experience is required.\nThat's a joke.\nIf you are an advisor to a CEO you have to have have been a CEO. Imagine that. That's why I like Sam, he used to be a\nCEO. He doesn't talk about it that much but he was a CEO and was good at it. The second part is that a professional CEO\nwill bring in, in the old days, a network of people that knows. Guys who brought technology in big corporations to\nimportant partners in the field to people in the press. We try to build that network on your behalf at the firm. I think we do a\nbetter job of that than anybody else. Those are the ways that we try to be different.\nQ: Putting yourself in other people's shoes is very important. Can you give us some tips?\nBen Horowitz: Putting yourself in other people\u2019s shoes is difficult in management. It's hard in daily life. It's even harder in\nmanagement because it's the stress at the moment. If a great employee is asking you for a raise, it is very hard for not to\nrespond because you do not want to lose them and they are not asking you for a raise randomly, they are asking you for\na reason. If you don't have a process in place to go stop back out, you have to pause yourself. If somebody comes to you\nwith something that you know is important, you want to feel like you have all the answers. Right now you guys are asking\nme questions and if I don't know the answer I will make something up because I want you guys to think I am smart.\nThe most importan thing is to pause. If you know something is really important and you haven't thought it through, just to\nsay, \"I am taking this really seriously but I have to pause because I have to think it through from all perspectives. I\u2019m going\nto come back.\" I end up doing that a lot just because there are a lot of things that you run into that you have never seen\nbefore. Most CEO's, including myself, learn this the hard way. You go ok, I'm going sneak away with this. Nobody's going\nto see me give them the raise. I'm going to do it and it\u2019s going to be all under the covers. Confidentiality baby. Then it\nblows up in your face three weeks later and you're like, \"Oh my God. What have I done?\" Or three months later or even a\nyear later.

Today's guest speaker is Emmett Shear. Emmett is the CEO of Twitch, which was acquired\nby Amazon, where he now works. Emmett is going to talk about how to do great user interviews; this is the talking to users\npart of \"How to Start a Start Up.\" It should be really useful. Thank you very much for coming!\nEmmett Shear: Thanks Sam. I started my first startup with Justin Kan right out of college. We started a company called\nKiko Calendar. It didn't go so well. Well, it went alright. We built it, we sold it on eBay. That's not necessarily the end you\nwant for your start up.\nIt was a good time. We learned a lot. We learned a lot about programming. We didn't know anything about calendars.\nNeither one of us were users of calendars. Nor did we, during the period of time we did the thing, go talk to anyone who\nactually did use a calendar. That was not optimal. We got the build stuff part of the startup down. We did not get to the talk\nto users part.\nThe second startup we started, we used a very common trick that lets you get away with not talking to users, which was\nthat we were our own consumer. We had this idea for a television show, Justin.tv, a reality show of Justin Kan's life. We\nbuilt technology and a website around the reality show we wanted to run. We were the users for that product. One way to\ncheat and get away with not talking to many other users is to build something that literally is just for you. Then you don't\nneed to talk to anyone else because you know what you want and what you need. But that is limiting way to start a\nstartup. Most startups are not built for the person who is using them. When you do that, every now and then you get really\nlucky and you are a representative of some huge class of people who all want the exact same thing you do. But very\noften, it just turns into a side project that doesn't go anywhere.\nWe kept working on Justin.tv for awhile and we actually achieved a good deal of success because it turned out that there\nwere people out there who wanted to do the same thing we did, which was broadcast our lives on the internet. The issue\nwith Justin.tv that kept us from achieving greatness is we hadn't figured out how to build towards anything beyond that\ninitial TV show. We built a great product. If you wanted to run a live 24/7 Reality television show about your life, we had\nthe website for you. We had exactly what you needed but if we wanted to go do more than that. We wanted to open it up\nto a broader spectrum of people and use cases, but we didn't have the insight to figure that out because we weren't that\nuser.\nSo we decided to pivot Justin.tv. We decided we needed to go in a new direction. We thought we built a lot of valuable\ntechnology but we hadn't identified a use case that would let it get really big. There were two directions that seemed\npromising. One was mobile and one was gaming. I lead the gaming initiative inside of the company. What we did with\ngaming that was very, very different from what we'd ever done before was we actually went and talked to users. Because\nwhile I loved watching gaming videos, I was very aware that neither I nor anyone else in the company knew anything\nabout broadcasting video games. I was amped about the content. I thought that there was market there. That was the\ninsight that wasn't common at the time, which was how much fun it was to watch video games.\nQuick show of hands, how many people know about watching video games on the internet here? If you don't know about\nwatching video games internet you should go read about it, because it's important context for the stuff I am going to talk\nabout. The main point is I thought it was awesome, but I didn't know anything about the important side of it, which is\nactually acquiring the content of the startup broadcasting. We ran a very large number of user interviews. We talked to a\nlot of people and that data formed the core of all the decision making for the next three years of product features on\nTwitch.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4015, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ea0670b-ee82-4ecf-a306-de095f42d1c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ea0670b-ee82-4ecf-a306-de095f42d1c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd820cb5-4435-44a5-bb76-b05bd065fc2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "4caa5ded7e139cb47191b639114a45a38fc54f88f6609ab7c151946297bca444", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "10a9e565-27fb-4054-88be-be4f18eafc68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "76735ac78f8b8c07311da72b20b05f277dc36085b0bc47f2c023b945b61124fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "60b01602-4d0d-4458-95af-67d626b68b8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "992165d396316ee8814dc0ed1ec82fe5b506d128b964b78aad86483de023a951", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "16baedd91f2334ac012908e9dd5d11d328a6a8b00999b685e09146f517e057ec", "text": "I was amped about the content.

We determined that the broadcasters were\nthe most important people because when we went and looked into the market, we looked into what determined why\npeople watched a certain stream or went to a certain website. They would just follow the content. You had a piece of\ncontent you loved and the broadcaster would come with you. That's actually the one really important point about user\ninterviews, which is that who you talk to is as important as what questions you ask and what you pull away from it.\nBecause if you go and talk to a set of users, if we had gone and talked to viewers only, we would have gotten completely\ndifferent feedback than if we were talking to the broadcasters. Talking to the broadcasters gave us insight into how to\nbuild something for them. That turned out to be strategically correct. I wish I could tell you the recipe for figuring who the\ntarget user is for your product, and who your target user should be, but there isn't a recipe. It comes down to thinking\nreally hard and using your judgment to figure out who you are really building this for.\nI want to do something interactive now. I'm going to get a bunch of ideas from you guys and I'm going to pick one of them.\nI want everyone to sit down and do step one of this process right now. Which people, where would you go to find the\npeople you needed to talk to in order to learn about what you should build. The idea we are going to use is a lecture\nfocused note taking app. The idea is: the state of the art for note taking is not good enough yet and I want to make a note\ntaking app that improves that experience. It will make taking notes in class better. Maybe it has collaboration features or\nmaybe it helps you focus better somehow. It has multimedia enhancements. All sorts of possible features. That's the idea.\nSo take 120 seconds right now and think about not what you would ask or what the right features for this app is, but who\nwould you talk to? Who is going to give you that feedback that is going to tell you whether this is good or not. It\u2019s good to\nthink in your head but actually write it down and come up with the five people you would talk to. The five types of people\nyou talk to, and who you think the most important one was. There's nothing like actually running through something and\ntrying to do it. Actually get it into your head that it's right way to do it. I'm gratified to hear the clicking of keyboards now. If\nyou are following along at home actually do it. Think about who would you talk to because that's the first question for\nalmost any startup. You need the answer to the question: who is my user and where am I going to find them?\nAlright, that's shorter than you normally would think about this problem. It's actually a really tricky problem, figuring out\nwhere to source people is pretty hard. We\u2019re going to move along in this highly abbreviated version of learning how to\nbuild a product and running a user interview.\nCan I get one volunteer from the audience to come up and tell us who you would talk to. And we'll talk about it.\nAudience Member 1: I would definitely talk to college students first, because we sit in a lot of lectures. Specifically, I want\nto talk to college students studying different subjects to see if they are an English major, if that makes a difference versus\nstudying Math or Computer Science in terms of how you want to take notes in different lectures.\nEmmett Shear: You're going to talk to a bunch of college students. Would you pick any particular subset of college\nstudents? We don't want to talk to all college students.\nAudience Member 1: I want to only talk to college students and break down the divisions by people who study different\nareas. It would make sense for people who have different study techniques, because some people take a lot of notes.\nSome people don't take that many notes but still jot stuff down.\nEmmett Shear: That's a really good start. Those are obviously the users you want to go talk to, especially if you are\ntargeting college students as the consumer.

Hello.\nAudience Member 2: Hi, I'm Stephanie.\nEmmett Shear: Hi Stephanie.\nAudience Member 2: Nice to meet you.\nEmmett Shear: Welcome. Thank you for agreeing to do this user interview with us. I want to hear from you about your note\ntaking habits. How do you take notes today?\nAudience Member 2: Sure, I take notes in a variety of ways. Because of speed and efficiency, and because I can come\nback to it later, it\u2019s easy for me to take notes on my laptop. A lot of those would be primarily text based, but in certain\nclasses, for example if I am taking a History class, most of it would be in text. But if I am taking a Physics class, there are\ngoing to be more complex diagrams and different angles I have to draw.\nEmmett Shear: What software do you use for this stuff today?\nAudience Member 2: I just do pen and paper for that.\nEmmett Shear: You do pen and paper. So you do a combination. You take notes with pen and paper. You take notes with\nthe computer sometimes.\nAudience Member 2: Yup.\nEmmett Shear: When you take all these notes, at the end, do you actually review them? Be honest! Do you actually go\nback and look at this notes?\nAudience Member 2: The pen and paper not so much. But yes to the software based. It's easier to access and it's easier\nfor me to share and collaborate and maybe even merge notes with classmates and friends.\nEmmett Shear: What did you use to take notes today on your computer?\nAudience Member 2: Google Docs and Evernote.\nEmmett Shear: Why two things at the same time?\nAudience Member 2: Evernote is easy if I am trying to just collect for myself. You can share, but Google Docs is easier to\nshare. If a friend has already created a folder in Google Docs, I just have to add to that folder. If it\u2019s for my personal use I\ntend to go more toward Evernote.\nEmmett Shear: It sounds like you have a lot of note taking collaborations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36b0db3b-b1bf-4cce-9616-4d15cea82919": {"__data__": {"id_": "36b0db3b-b1bf-4cce-9616-4d15cea82919", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fe258a1-ce5b-44d0-907d-3bbe8174061f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "ac42e605465bb705b97d3a02ff58471722e69ac6688aa30f4b025c947a490816", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58495617-876c-4a31-9f65-ce6c10f35c87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "cd53069c9447eb742ea0f1ce65b3270b7b655ae70f3d5f37680a7fe8a8de8b37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81cad711-a4b6-4998-9417-fb75aff50d45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1631aae1eeb82741576a3084e1b7612bd4a9e36f31e5989e6907a3702f3a8c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "48052932a4f7004bfcb82568d95ffb3e72b84a60ee07eece34af4abb051773a2", "text": "Audience Member 2: Yeah, I wish it was integrated.\nEmmett Shear: Tell me more about that. Do you wind up taking most of the notes, most of the value out of notes that other\npeople take? Or is it mostly your own notes you review at the end of the semester? How does that work?\nAudience Member 2: It's mostly mine because I am pretty picky about the way I like things organized. Design wise or\nformatting, even color, I am really particular with. The font that we use really effects the way I study. So I tend to\npersonalize notes, even after I merge them.\nEmmett Shear: So you're pulling notes from other people but then you merge them into what works for you. Awesome! If\nyou have Evernote notes and you have Google Docs notes, and you have pen and paper notes, once the semester is\nover, do you ever go back to any of that stuff or is it per quarter? Once the quarter is over, do you ever go back to any of\nthat stuff?\nAudience Member 2: For classes not so much, but if it's notes that I have taken for talks, like these for example, or if it's\ninterview prep, I tend to go back because I like to keep these things fresh in my mind. They help me prep for future things.\nEmmett Shear: That's interesting. Tell me more about that. You take notes not just in class.\nAudience Member 2: I take notes to summarize main points. For example, inspirational quotes from talks like these. If I am\ngoing to an event where I am going to meet someone, notes help me remember what was at the talk.\nEmmett Shear: Awesome. Normally I would actually dig into a lot more detail. There are a huge amount of open\nquestions that are still in my mind after hearing that. Which people do you collaborate with? How long are your notes?.\nHow much time do you spend note taking? I would dig into her current behavior but in the interest of time and not making\neveryone hear about the intricacies of one person\u2019s note taking habits forever, we're going to move on. Thank you very\nmuch Stephanie.\nAudience Member 2: Thank you.\nEmmett Shear: I appreciate that. You notice we are not talking about the actual content of the app at all. I'm not really\ninterested in features. I don't want to know about a specific feature set in Google Docs or Evernote. I might dig a little more\ninto which features actually get used. If she's actively collaborating, how does that work? I heard some interesting things,\n\" We use a folder.\" That's interesting to me.\nThe main thing you're trying to do when running this first set of interviews is not necessarily ask questions about\noptimizing user flow. Or questions about the specifics of any of that stuff. That can be distracting because users think they\nknow what they want. You get the horseless carriage effect where you're asked for a faster horse instead of asked to\ndesign the actual solution to the problem.\nSo you want to stay as far away from features as possible because the things they tell you feel overwhelmingly real.\nWhen you have a real user asking you for a feature, it's very hard to say no to them because here's a real person who\nreally has this problem. They're saying, \"Build me this feature.\" But as you start to talk to lots of people and really get a\nsense for what their problems are, you figure out if this is actually a promising area or not.\nBased on what I heard there, starting from that user interview, I'm not necessarily positive there is a problem. At least\nthere might not be a big enough problem that it's worth building a whole new product for. I didn't hear a lot of things that\nwere big blockers, where there is something really wrong with the way it was working. Unless I have some big idea, I\nwould take that as a negative sign. That doesn't necessarily mean you can't move forward and keep talking to more\npeople. Just because you don't get anything out of talking to the first person doesn't mean there are not going to be more\npeople who actually have a problem.

If you are going to build just one feature on top of Google\nDocs, what would that feature be? For a new product like this, it might be a good way to start thinking about where to go.\nThey are extensively using this thing right now, how can we make that experience just one quantum better? Something\nthat would be really exciting to this person, something that would be one step ahead. Take two minutes and think about\nwhat that feature might be. Try to come up with what you might do based on what you heard from Stephanie that could\nconvince her to switch away from her current collaborative, multi-person, all working together work flow on Google Docs\nto your new thing that has the features of Google Docs plus this one special thing that is going to make it more useful and\nconvince them to stop using the thing they are already using.\nAwesome, alright. I am going to invite our third guest up.\nAudience Member 3: The reason she uses Evernote is because of sticky note type notes. More thoughts and like details. I\nfeel that Google Docs has documents and not smaller notes. I feel like a feature that would be super would be a mobile\nversion of drive that isn't clunky and doesn't make you use documents could be useful.\nEmmett Shear: Awesome. That's a good insight. That's exactly one of the things you get out of that user interview. Now\nyou have this idea. You've gotten this user\u2019s feedback. What if we had a Google Docs that had the collaborative aspects\nand the group aspects but where you could pull in more little one off notes. A product designed more around note taking.\nThe question is now, once you have this idea, is this enough? Is this something people would actually switch to? There\nare two ways to validate that. One, if you are quick at programming you can literally just go build it, throw it out into the\nworld, and see what happens. When that works, it's an excellent way to approach the problem. But a lot of the time that\none little thing that's a bit better might take you three months to actually build. So you want to go out and validate that idea\nfurther before you start building it.\nYou might take that idea and draw diagrams of what it would look like. Draw the work flow and put that in front of people.\nThe one thing you really don't want to do is ask them about a great idea for a feature. Ask them, \"Are you excited about\nit?\" Because the feedback you get from users if you tell them about a feature and ask them, \"Is this feature good?\" is often,\n\"Oh yeah that's great.\" When you actually build it, you find out that while they thought it was a clever idea, no one actually\ncares to switch and get it. So the one question you can't ask is, \"Is this feature actually good or not?\"\nSam Altman: What is the minimum that you can do to actually build on that question? Between asking and actually\nbuilding the full thing?\nEmmett Shear: What's the minimum you can actually get away with to validate your product, given you can't actually just\ngo and ask them, \"Is this good or not?\" It's highly dependent on the particular feature. Usually the best thing you can do is\njust hack something together. If your idea is to build something on top of Google Docs, don't go rebuild Google\nDocuments but for note taking. Find a way to write a browser extension that stuffs that little bit of incremental feature in\nand see if it's actually useful for people. Find a way to cheat is what it comes down to, because if you can't actually put it in\nfront of people it's really, really hard to find that out.\nFor bigger things, where you are actually trying to get people to spend money, it gets a lot easier.

What else was going\non in their life? When you talk to detailed users of your product, they come back to you with very detailed things about\nfeatures because they get mired in the features. You have to sort of read between the lines. They ask us for things like, \u201cI\nwant a way to clear the ban list in my chatroom.\" That was actually a very common request because there was a very\nparticular issue with how our chatroom is worked. People would ask for the ability to edit titles of highlights after creating\nthem. This stuff was really consistent.\nAs we talked to broadcasters, we probably talked to twelve to fourteen broadcasters of the Justin.tv gaming platform, we\ngot all this feedback. \"Your competitors have all these cool features like polls and scrolling text. I can personalize chat\nthere.\" Then we have some positive feedback. \"You guys don't have ads. You're able to ban trolls.\" A bunch of stuff about\nchat, around interactivity with their viewers. That was all really interesting. This is what the Justin.tv broadcasters wanted\nus to build. This is where they felt pain using the product. If you thought that what we did was go and address these\nproblems, you would be wrong. People who are using your service already are willing to put up with all these issues,\nwhich kind of means that these are probably not the biggest problems. If you are willing to ignore the fact that you can edit\nthe ban list and that titles are editable, that there is no way to get trolls out of your channel and you're using the service\nanyways, maybe those aren't huge problems. That brings up a really important point, which is you have to compare\ngroups of people. And compare the level in which they argue.\nHere we have competitor broadcaster feedback, which is really interesting. This is stuff we heard a lot from people who\nwere using other broadcast platforms. They wanted to be able to switch multiple people onto their channel at the same\ntime. They complained about us not having a revshare program. They talked a lot about how they were trying to make a\nliving and they really wanted to make money pursuing this this gaming broadcasting thing. They talked about video\nstability. Our service wasn't good in Europe. Globally, video stability was this huge, huge issue. If you compare and\ncontrast, it was really different. What people who didn't use our service cared about was completely different than the\npeople who were using our service. We focused on this stuff because this was the stuff that was so bad that people\nweren't even willing to use our service. Most of it we hadn't actuallythought about it because our user base happened to\nbe well educated and knew about all their options. Reaching out to them meant that they probably already tried all four\nservices and actually had an opinion. It's great when you can get users who are that informed and understand the space\nthat well.\nThe other important thing we did was talk to non-broadcasters. We talked to all the people who weren't using us or our\ncompetitors. In many ways, those were the most important people. Talking to your competitors is a a short term win,\nunless your software is like Google, which is a search engine which everyone uses, then there may be no non-users to\nconvert. In the case of gaming broadcasting, almost everyone is a non-user. The majority of people you are competing\nwith are non-users. They are people who have never used your service before and what they say is actually the most\nimportant. What they say is the thing that blocks you from expanding the size of the market with your features.\nIf all you do is look at your competitors and talk to people who use your competitors' products, you can never expand.\nYou're not learning things that help you expand the size of the market. You want to talk to people who aren't even trying to\nuse these things yet. Who've thought about it maybe, but who aren\u2019t into it. What did they say? My computer isn't fast\nenough.

People wanted stability and quality. People wanted universal access for viewers all around the\nworld. That became our focus. We dumped almost all of our resources into things no one ever mentioned in an interview.\nThose were the things that actually addressed the problem. The way that you can tell that it worked is as we would build\nthese things, we would go back to exact same people we interviewed and we would say, \"You told us you really cared a\nlot about making money. We built you this subscription program that will let you make money.\"\nIt's astonishing because most people had actually never had that experience. They had never talked to someone and\nsaid, \"It would be really great if your product had feature X\" and then a month later your product actually has feature X, or\nat the very least a feature that addresses the problem that they brought up. The people we converted first to our product\nwere the people that we talked to about user research. They were the ones who were the most impressed. Which is fun. It\nreally worked, because we picked people who were representative. We picked big broadcasters. Small ones. Medium\nones. We made sure were addressing their concerns. That was completely different from how we approached the\nproblem at Justin.tv.\nWith Justin.tv when we tried to do this, we'd go through huge amounts of data. We spent tons of time looking through\nGoogle Analytics, Mixpanel, and in-house analytics tools. Figuring out how people were trying to use the service, where\nour traffic came from, completion rates on flows. You can learn things from that. I'm not telling you not to look at your data.\nBut it doesn't tell you what the problems are you need to address. We would invent these ideas at Justin.tv without talking\nto someone and then nine times out of ten, that idea would turn out to be bad. That\u2019s actually one of the disappointing\nthings about doing user interviews and getting user feedback, which is why I think so many people don't do it. You're\ngoing to get negative news about your favorite feature most of the time. You're going to have this great idea and you're\ngoing to talk to users and it\u2019s going to turn out that nobody actually wants it. They are actually concerned about a\ncompletely different set of things and they don't care about what you thought was important at all. That\u2019s a little bit sad, but\nthink about how sad you'd be in four months when you launch that feature and it turns out no one actually wants to use it.\nThat's the lecture section. I want to take some questions from the audience.\nAudience Member 4 : What do you see startups get most wrong about interviews? Most startups don't do them at all, but\nthe ones that do, what are their most common mistakes?\nEmmett Shear: The most common mistake is showing people your product. Don't show them your product. It\u2019s like telling\nthem about a feature. You want to learn what's already in their heads. You want avoid putting things there. The other\nthing is asking about your pet feature direction. If you think you want to add subscriptions to your product, going and\nasking people, \"Would you pay for a subscription? Would you use this feature?\"\nAnother big mistake people make is talking to who is available rather than talking to who they need to talk to. There are\ncertain users are really easy to get at because they are members of your forum already. You have some product forum,\nyou talk to the users on that forum because they\u2019re easy to access. We spent weeks digging for identifying information\nand figuring out who these people were so we could talk to them. This was a site that did not support messaging, so there\nwas no obvious way to interact with them. We spent a bunch of time trying to network and find those users. Because if you\njust talk to who's easy to talk to, you're not getting the best data. The fortunate side there is almost everyone is flattered to\nbe asked what they think, so they will actually talk to you and tell you things.\nAudience Member 5: How hard was it to get buy in from the rest of your company?

You don't want to do interviews over email if you can avoid it, because\ninterviews over email are non-interactive. The most interesting learnings come from the, \u201cInteresting. Tell me more.\" The\ninstant you hit this vein, they will say something that you didn't expect. And then you should drop into detective mode.\nDetective mode is, \"Huh, that's interesting. Can you tell me more about that?\" People don't like silence, so they'll keep\ntalking to feel the void. The best part about doing an interview over Skype or doing it in person is that you have that\ninteractive feedback. You can actually pull a lot more out of people. Email interviews are basically useless. In person or\nover Skype interviews are also easy to record. Make sure you ask them if it's ok to record. It's not polite to record people\nwithout their consent, but if they are willing to give you a user interview, they'll probably willing for you to record it as well.\nAudience Member 6: What about the international market? You mentioned that you have a lot of users in Korea.\nEmmett Shear: That's really hard. To this day Twitch works way better in English speaking countries than it does in non-\nEnglish speaking countries. A big part of that is we are much better at talking to people in English speaking countries and\nlearning what their needs are. We are not as good at that in other Countries. We've tried to address that by hiring people\nwho speak Korean and having them translate. We've tried to address it by finding representative people who speak both\nEnglish and Korean and reaching out to them. But the problem is you're not actually getting a representative sample, no\nmatter how hard you try. The very fact that they are a fluent English speaker means they are not representative of all the\npeople who don't speak fluent English. It's a hard problem. It\u2019s why companies find it easier to build markets in their home\ncountry. It's really hard to talk to users abroad.\nAudience Member 7: What channels do you use to reach out to them? And do you ever compensate them?\nEmmett Shear: The channels we used to reach out to them were onsite messaging systems. Most websites have some\nway to contact the user. If they are a visible user of another website, you use that site's messaging system and say, \"Hey. I\nwas watching your stream...\u201d Or, \"I'd love to ask you some questions about your usage. Would you mind hopping on a\nSkype call?\" We also find out where those people were. We'd run into them at events because a lot of these people go to\nthe same events. We wouldn't run the user interview at the event, but we'd get to know them. We would exchange\nbusiness cards and we would get in touch with them. We tend not to compensate people. If people don't care enough\nabout the problem to like someone who is trying to solve it, you're probably barking up the wrong tree. We never had any\ntrouble getting people to talk to us without paying them.\nAudience Member 7: What about onsite user feedback tools?\nEmmett Shear: This is a whole second set of user feedback that's really important. You're talking about when you have a\nnew product and you want to see if it's actually going to work or not. You put it in front of people and see how they use it\nor not. That is super, super important. It can tell you where you went wrong building something before you launch it,\nwhich is great. It doesn't tell you what to build. It helps you iron out the kinks and edges of the thing you did build.\nGenerally speaking, that wasn't the user feedback we were getting. I mean that stuff's good, it's much more similar though\nto the data driving approach. You're finding out why people are dropping off of this flow. You're not finding out the\nproblem you should really be solving. What do they care about as a human? This early stage user interview is crucial for\nstartups. That's where you want to focus.

We knew\nthat they were already interested in the behavior that we needed and they were willing to do it at all. Therefore all we had\nto do was convince them to switch, which is much easier to do than to create a new behavior. We did that because we\nhad to get some quick wins.

There wasn't a lot of cohesion, but\nnow it's very different. You said you originally spoke to broadcasters and streamers themselves. How has that changed?\nFor example, ? has banned users or professional players from streaming their own stuff. Did you try to gain leverage with\nthat?\nEmmett Shear: Yeah, so the question is about the game publishers. Game publishers are important people in the space.\nAny big company for that matter isn't going to give you the time of day as a small startup. Which is both good and bad. It\nmeans you don't need to talk to them because they're not interested in you. But it means you actually just can't talk to\nthem. We tried but no one wanted to talk to us. They did once we started getting some traction and becoming a bit of a\nplayer in the space.\nI don't really want to talk that bad about them because they were nice enough about it. When you are a tiny little startup,\nthere are lots of tiny little startups, and they don't have the time to talk to all of you. As we've gotten bigger, game\npublishers have become increasingly important for us. If I was to talk about who Twitch does user interviews with now,\nwho we pull information form now, it would include game publishers. Definitely! They've become much more active in the\nspace. They weren't particularly active three or four years ago. The really important user interviews in general are from\nthe pool of people you care about, and that is going to shift over time. The people who get you started for the first six\nmonths are not who will be using it three years later. It's very important you keep doing this stuff. One of the things that is\nreally easy to do is to do a little bit of it in the beginning and achieve some success and then stop talking to new people.\nThat's a good way to make the next set of features you build be not as good as the first ones.\nAudience Member 10: How do you give good user feedback if you're a user?\nEmmett Shear: How do you give good user feedback? I want a user to tell me what they are really thinking. What their\nproblems really are. To just sort of ramble. I want someone to just tell me about stuff in their life. The more you learn about\nthem as a person and the context of what they are doing, the easier it is to understand why they want the things they\nwant. That's really the critical question. What I am looking for in someone when I am doing a user interview is someone\nwho is going to be willing to talk a lot and be willing to give me a full picture. On flip side, if you want to help people out\nwith good user interview feedback, ramble.Just talk about everything.\nAlright great.

Sam and I have known each other for a long time. We met in the early days when he was\non his company journey. He asked me to talk today about the hardware journey of building products. I want to give you\nguys a little bit of an overview of Jawbone: what we do, how we think about the world, and how that informs how we build\nproducts. I'll then go into the process of how we design, how we develop, and how that all comes together through what\nwe do to change categories.\nI always like to start with the broadest thinking. The way we look at the world is we think of ourselves at this intersection of\nreally crafted innovation in engineering that's almost invisible to the user in terms of its functionality, even beyond design.\nWe have been designing products for well over a decade now. We think that the conversation has shifted even beyond\ndesign into beauty. It's the intersection of engineering meets beauty. The whole point is to help people have a better life\nwith technology.\nLargely speaking we play in this world of \"The Internet of Things.\" We were there before there was such a moniker. We\nhave smart devices that have computing power and connectivity with sensors that are measuring all kinds of things.\nThey're wirelessly connected and they're all talking to you. We started on this journey really, really early. Right out of\nengineering school here, we were developing core technology. We decided to build consumer products around that.\nOur first consumer product was the headset. We created a headset that became a wearable computer. It was the first\ntraveling headset. That was when we started thinking about wearable computing. We then invented the wireless speaker\nspace around Bluetooth and audio. I will talk a little about that journey. Most recently, we focused our attention on the\nwearable health revolution and using a lot of the sensors that we did in the first generation of headsets and applying\nthem to other parts of the body to understand more about users.\nOur view of this world, having been here for a long time, is that it is a little bit of a mess. In the internet of things everything\nis smart, connected, and has an app built for it, but that doesn't mean that it is easy for users. Your microwave, your\nrefrigerator, your car, your Xbox, your Xfinity Comcast, everything has an app. They don't talk to each other. It's really\nconfusing for the user. We think that there is a desperate need for an organizing principal around all of this. This is the\ncore of when we start to think about how we build and opportunities to create products. We think about where the world is\ngoing. If there is going to be such a world that everyone's talking about on the internet of things which is happening, you\ndesperately need these organizing principals so that it's easier for users to understand how to come in and interact with\nthese services. So we think that is the shift from less about the actual things to being about the individual user.\nWhen everyone is talking about wearables and you have things like Google Glass and Apple Watch, ultimately what we\nbelieve is that when you have things that are on your body 24/7, they become a perfect context engine for everything in\nthe world around you. My phone is not on me. It\u2019s in my jacket or sometimes on the charger. But my Up is on me. And it\nunderstands everything that is happening when it's tracking my heart rate. It's tracking my respiration. It's tracking all\nthese different things. When I say context engine, I can tell the smart thermostat, my Nest, that I am hot or cold. That\ndevice doesn't have that understanding. I can tell it I am hot but that device doesn't know if I'm hot because I'm sick, I went\nfor a run, or if it's hot outside. I can tell your car that you're falling asleep, agitated, or irritated. This is ultimately where we\nthink the world is moving. Wearables are going to be the center of this revelation around everything being connected and\nsmart. We are going to drive what a lot of those interactions are going to be and how they\u2019re going to work. That's the first\nprincipal that we think about. Where are things going?

You can't actually create a service that people engage with or that gets lots of data that can then go power all these\nother things if it doesn't start with great hardware. So that's where we start, we try to build these magical experiences in\nhardware that are powered by software. We have developed world class software application expertise. We have to be\ngood there, from an engagement perspective, like an Instagram or WhatsApp.\nOn the data side we have to know what to do with this massive amount of information. We have to know how to process it,\npush it, and have it work for the user. We really see ourselves at the intersection of hardware, software, and data. These\nare three equal stools that have to work together in order to unlock that experience around something that is on you, that\nknows what's happening and then talks to the rest of world. That's a key piece of what we do. It's different than what a lot\nof other companies doing. It allows and requires to play at all levels of stack.\nThis was a complicated thing for us to put together because typically people who are great at hardware understand\nmechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and how those things interact. They understand how you build tools at\nscale. They're not typically great at building software and services. It's a very different discipline and requires a very\ndifferent skill set. When we first put those pieces together, it created a lot of interesting friction in the company. Our\nsoftware and application team was so used to moving really, really fast and iterating, whereas in the hardware world\nyou've got to take your time because your iteration cycles are much more deliberate. You have tooling that takes sixteen\nweeks. You can't just tweak stuff and you can't hack it in the same way. It was interesting to see that when we put all these\npieces together, the hardware learned to move faster. The software guys thought more about how they could resolve\nexperiences before they actually shipped it, versus just throwing something out and A/B testing it. Then the data science\ninforms all of that with more information to make decisions.\nSo how do we think about and how do we build products? How do we change categories? First of all, everything for us is\na system. We don't think about it discretely as a piece of hardware or discretely as an application or discretely as a\nplatform. We think across the whole thing. This is an example with Up. We have these tracking sensors on the body out\nrhythms there it connects to the phone where you have this engaging application service experiences. We use the\nsensors in the phone. That talks to a lot of stuff we are doing in cloud where we are taking all that information, driving\ninsight on it and then we have a huge platform of thousands of developers - where they're thousands of apps that then\nplugin and also create more experiences. And so we think about it across the whole spectrum. And I, I'll come back to this\nsystem think in, in a second.\nWhat does the actual process of creation look like? This is fun for me because we don't actually talk about this very often.\nWe keep it confidential and private and I know that we're on a live cast. It's fun for me to talk about this for the first time. It's\na quite deliberate process. This is a little bit of what it looks like. This is a map where we are much unbridled in our\nimagination in the exploration phase. We start to validate some of our concepts, bring those ideas tighter, and tighten\nthem. And then we actually start to build a product. Launch it and then iterate. That's the simplest way to look at it. I'll take\nyou through each of these steps.\nThe exploration phase is very wild. It's imaginative. We think about the vision of where the world is going and what our\nstrategy is. What does the brand stand for? You're dreaming. You're imagining it. How do I disrupt? What's the future\ngoing to look like? It is a little bit of a science project and we talk about it in that way. We build from inspiration, insight,\nand raw creativity.

It's a hand off between various stages and very functional teams in the\ncompany. You pull together and you're solving problems as you implement and launch it. You learn. You see what users\nthink. You start to think about where does this stand in that experience continuum that you've been imaging where the\nworld is going to go. What have we achieved? What haven't we achieved? What have we learned from our users? How\ndoes that change what we're thinking? And then we start right over again.\nThat's the broadest way to think about it. The exploration phase is very much like a building and tinkering process. A lot of\nit is driven by demo Fridays where people have an opportunity to showcase their work. We find that's a great way to pull it\ntogether, pull it into a form where others can consume it and give feedback. It's a really it is a show and tell. Obviously\nhack-a-thons are a big part of it. There's lots of data that gets driven. It's lead by our Strategic Development Team, which\nis traditionally called an R&D Team. There is participation from product and engineering, both hardware and software.\nBut they're sort of taking a back seat and they're looking at what these explorations are. The Executives at the company at\nthis phase are more of a signing board. They\u2019re there to poke and prod and tell people, \u201cHey think about this.\" Or \"Did you\ntry that? How does that work?\"\nIn this phase, in order to move to the next threshold, we think, \"Would I give this guy 50 grand?\" It's like an angel\ninvestment. Would I give this guy 50 grand to go explore this and see if there's is there something to do? And our CTO is\nthe final decision maker. He gets to pick internally and say, \"You know what? I like all the feedback. This is the one I want\nto go chase down and see what happens.\"\nThen we get into the validation phase. This where gets really interesting. It's still led by R&D but they're really poking at\nthe idea and saying, \u201cHow does this work? We have leadership meetings with the broader cross functional team. I have\nto show results. I have to go through a scientific process to outline why this works. Why is it going to happen?\" This is\nwhen we start formulating an important tool in the company, which is what we call WHYS. Defining the WHY of what we\nare doing. WHY does this exist? What problem does it solve? I'm going to come back to that in a minute.\nAt this point it's still an R&D lead, but this is when our industrial design team and a few project guys come in and think,\n\"Ok how can I pull this concept into something physical, if it's hardware? How is that going to interact with the rest of the\npieces of the system?\" Our product experience team is still driving a lot of the core values and the story boarding, but it\nstarts to become a lot more real, when we start thinking, \"Ok, how we will build this? How expensive is this going to be?\nWhat's the budget going to be?\" At that point, we start to really validate if we can actually build it. Do we have wait three\nyears for batteries to be there? Do we have to wait for this other innovation to happen? Do we have to wait from a budget\nperspective? Is there a business viability? Then we start to really sketch briefs. This where I come in and make the final\ndecision. \"There\u2019s really a there there. And we can now take this to the next level and get into play.\"\nThen we go into the concept phase. This is when the responsibilities shift from the R&D folks to what we call the product\nexperience team.

What are the most important problems we're going to solve? We\ncall them \"Hero Experiences.\" What are we going to do? What is the bar that would be acceptable?\nAt this point we start to really resolve the WHYS, which I will show you again in a minute. Why is this different from the\ncompetition? From the category? Where does it go? We don't like to do one off things. We have to see a broader vision.\nThis is part of the creation experience. We look at where do we think the world is moving and think about how this is\ngoing to be a stepping stone to that ultimate end vision. That\u2019s where the road map starts to get flushed out. Again, I have\nthe ability here to be the final decision maker with my team and say, \"Yup. We're going to move this to this next phase.\"\nHere is also where we look at some of these things. I want to get into some specific examples. We have fast track\nprograms. We took, for example, the Jambox when we were in this phase and we said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go through\nanother phase.

We can\nrecalibrate the go to market possibility.\nAfter this stage it shifts from that Product Experience Team to our Product Managers, who are really defining the business\nplan. When is it going to launch, when is it going to get into the retail calendar, what is the software release cycle. They\nare prototyping. They're starting to make a lot of those tradeoffs. \"Ok we wanted to build this. We can't do that but here's\nwhat we can do. We want to be this way. We want these functional experiences. We are going to sacrifice battery life,\nwhatever it is.\" That's when we start to really pull those decisions and start to look at it. It's a big juggling act at that point.\nThe product guys are driving that. That's when again, we look at and synthesize all of what we put together and we say,\n\"Ok. Does it actually cross enough things off our list? Does it meet that minimum viability?\" Because we always start with,\nas you can tell, this very big wish list of what's possible and what we can do. Then we start to wheel it down and ask,\n\"Does this cross enough of the value threshold that we think it's worth pursuing?\"\nNow can we actually move it into the development phase where again Product Management Team continues to lead it.\nBut now you're starting to really get deep. This is where engineering comes in and is really starting to sign off on building\nit. Here's the time schedule and how we ship. The Product Team is looking at how we should go deeper. How can we\nincrease engagement? What are the little innovations? What are the tuning? What are the things that we need to do to\nmake all that happen?\nWe've been fortunate to have a lot of wonderful response to products that we've built. We take a lot of care and time in the\ndetails of this development and concerting phase, around little details that create these magical experiences. For\nexample, when you turn on Jambox, you have this pretty cool sound that goes \"WOOO.\" It took months to come up with\nthe right audio tuning. We worked with a lot of different audiographers to create that sound, but every time someone turns\nit on I see them smile and laugh.\nThe feel of the rubber retyping: there's one manufacturer in the world that was able to make the rubber at the quality that\nwe wanted and the colors that we wanted for the first Jambox. All of those little magical details. How do you resolve them,\neven in software? When we had the first UP, when you plugged it in your sleep graph showed up. Even just the\nanimations of how the bars would show up and the way cards would flow, that was a detail that we thought about. How is\nthis going interact, how is the user going to experience it? How are they going to feel it? A lot of that stuff happens even at\nthe stage where you sign off on a program. You're making those kind of decisions all the way through and you're trading\noff and you're doing it in the context of this bigger picture. Innovation is an opportunity to keep refining and to keep doing\nall that stuff.\nHow do we think about it at a broader level? What is the framework for how we think about these user signature\nexperiences? Well we start to think of these WHYS. Which is an articulation of the problem that we are solving. And then\nthe themes around how these become actionable concepts. Then we build these cross functional pods that take a person\nfrom the Product Experience Team, a person from Hardware Engineering, a person from Software Engineering, a person\nfrom the Data Team, and we put them together.

Again, Jambox\nis great example of that. We talked to some people when were were thinking about making that product.\nA little story for you guys, when we launched the Jambox in the fall of 2010, the market for wireless speakers as an\noverall speaker market was zero percent. Zero percent. Last Christmas, which was Christmas of 2013, it was 78% of the\nmarket.

I need it and I would be willing to pay for it.\" But when we did it, it\ntransformed an industry. So this is where these WHYS become super important. Focus in on what you're doing. I'll go\nthrough one example in the audio space, which is the Jambox example, and then I'll take you through a little bit of how\nwe did it in UP. Particularly UP24. It starts with what we call category strategy. This is the experience framework.\nOur view was that all your content and media experiences are now in your phone. They are no longer in iPads, iPods, or\nyour computer. So we need a different way to interact with it that needs to be as portable on mobile, as high quality. That\nwas our fundamental thinking. Then we said that that experience needs to be seamless across time and space. So you\ncould go anywhere through it, in a different car, traveling, or around the house. That was fundamentally what we were\ndoing. We said that\u2019s why this category should exist. That was the human problem.\nThen we said, what's in it for Jawbone? Why should we do this? When you think about the broader macro context, the\ninternet of things, this was our entry into your home. This is why everybody talks about all these things in your house from\nlights to thermostats to fridges to anything that is connected media is still the killer app that's in your house. It's where we\nsell millions and millions of units. So we said speakers can be our entry into that world that's around you and it can be\nthumb of the things that we want to do from a software and service perspective in your home. There's an interesting\nstrategy for solving user problems but then why does it matter to Jawbone. Those two have to go together because A)\nwe're not a philanthropic not-for profit-industry and B) if you do this well, it allows you to keep making great products, to\nkeep moving forward, and to keep doing interesting things. That's how we put that together.\nThen we built what we call the experience conium. Is where it is today? And when we started it was a Blue Tooth\nspeaker. Right? That was the core enabling technology that it allows us to connect to stuff. Where do we think it's going to\ngo tomorrow? What happens when we can dream in future? We start to really try to live into tomorrow and the future and\nsort of the thing that we built today as a gradual - stepping stone to graduate users starting one place continue to move -\ncontinue to move through that. That gives us a view of how we also make these tradeoffs. Because we said we're not\ngoing to put this into this product but we have a space for it in the next one. We know that we can move users to that and\nthey will be ready for it. That\u2019s a lot of where we build stuff is we sort of define that experience contain.\nWe talk about this a lot. We don't think of ourselves as a hardware team or a software team or a data company. We think\nof ourselves as an experiences company. It's not just about this physical device or that feature. It's about the system. It's\nabout how the pieces come together. So when we start to define these WHYS, they become the problem statement. We\nsay, \"Ok how do we use a piece of hardware? How do we use a service in the cloud? How do we use an application? A\nsound? A button? How do we solve this user experience problem that we have and what\u2019s the right distribution across\nthat system? Where should you attack the problem? Where do we need to innovate and where do we need to pull it\ntogether\" That's a big, big, big part of the thinking that helps us in doing.\nWhen we think about these experiences, it's really about the context of why it's magical to the user. Like I said, the system\nis a flagship and then it has to go to a level of emotional connection where you feel that without it you're lost. I am going to\ngo home and get it if I don't have it.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3995, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe876dd5-2f57-4350-a750-b9d894836f69": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe876dd5-2f57-4350-a750-b9d894836f69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "785a8bf1-e728-4bfd-a019-5e5b612bd5c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2bc0fcc0c46704f194fb57e0db967e5290aab5896cbc4fcc9690a0d793a65977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f4843ec-9850-4632-97a2-386b330b1c2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "60564841e4fc843d926b9f0784b01673143f039950ce0014e73f708846210757", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af11e625-874c-4927-9434-23b8d74a8b8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61b636e0f33798363fad234801ffc2143b4c1a2cd328bcf417042cc5fe32ffba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e910ccf869e509c5e1372ee96168e696fe2b08d6a468eb68aeabfb35bf64d7fe", "text": "We\nsay, \"Ok how do we use a piece of hardware?

Those are the principals that govern all these things. We have to keep asking\nourselves those questions. Is it doing that? We pull this all together to create an experience framework. This is essentially\na brief for your engineering team. for your design team, and they can go back and say, \"What are we doing and why are\nwe doing it? How does that work? How do we create it?\"\nAnd then we have a whole process, Blueberry is one of the internal code names. But the user experience process starts\nwith a better resource, so we do actually listen to users and talk to them. But we talk to them in a very specific way, we\nstart looking for those key insights. We concept them and then we start to build. This is why we go to find those lists of\nconsumer problems. The principles, how do we think about approaching that? What are the solutions?And then what's\nrequired in the product to make that happen. Sam?\nSam Altman: Could, could you talk about how you balance the fact that a user would never, told you they wanted to pay\n$200 for a wireless speaker.\nHosain Rahman: Yeah.

You guys probably aren't familiar enough with this yet, but there are standard tools for what people do in focus\ngrouping, where they say, \"Would you try this, would you pay this, do you want this feature, what do you care about.\"\nThat's one way to do it. We don't usually get really great answers. We ask different kinds of questions. We say, \"How\nmuch music do you listen to when you are with other people? How do you play that music? Do you listen to a\nheadphones, or do you listen over the speakers on your phone? How often are you with other people? How often do you\nwant a personalized experience? How often do you want to share? How often do you?\"\nWe ask a lot of questions. We just ask different ones. We don't ask them specific things about, do you want this or do you\nwant that. We ask them: how do they behave? How do they live? A great example is the iPod. If you said to somebody, \"If\nyou could put a thousand songs in your pocket and take them anywhere,\" that's cool. Not, \"Do you want a digital portable\nmusic player?\"\nAgain it's at a price that was more than your phone. So you have to separate what are questions that you can ask that are\ngoing to help make you smarter about your thesis versus trying to get somebody to validate it for you. That's the real\nseparation. No one's going to tell you what to build, if they do then they should do it and not you. You're the one who's\nmaking that decision, you've got the thesis, you've got the creative idea, you've got the innovation. You gotta use these\npeople to help you make it better and to refine your thinking. That's the difference. Make sense?\nI'm going to switch over to Up24, which is the product that we've had on the market, our wireless products for health\ntracking. The WHYS of Up24 are really simple. First of all, let me start with the WHYS for Up. The idea there was there's\nso much that we know about the world today, through Twitter, Facebook, social media, access to the internet, Google, etc,\nbut we know nothing about ourselves. We have no idea why some days I sleep eight hours and feel terrible, but some\ndays I sleep three and feel awesome.\nOur thought was: could we take a lot of this sensor technology, help people understand more about themselves, and start\nto then make better decisions about how they live better? That was the first product. This was the second product we said:\nokay, great, now that we have wireless connectivity, it's not just about Bluetooth or wireless, it's about the fact that I can\nuse that real time flow of information to understand what's happening with me and take action on it. I can get the data in a\nmore meaningful, relevant, contextually important way at the moment that it matters. I can also get back guidance in a\nstructured way that can help me go do things. I want that ongoing encouragement, because everybody knows that they\nwant to be better, but they fall down. They want a fluid way to interact with this.\nThis is what we're building in Up24. We had this very crisp set of five things that were the WHYS of why we're building this\nproduct and why we're doing it. Our point of view was that it was going to, we had this sort of fundamental narrative going\nback to the experience framework where we said everything we do in UP is about helping people track and understand\nthem, track themselves, was understand, which is taking all that data and converting it into knowledge.\nThe third part was act, so track, understand, and act. That is our narrative for everything we do in the wearable health\nspace and it will be for the entirety of what we do. It's help people get more information on results. Data is great,\nunderstanding is better. Convert that into things that they can create real knowledge that they can then take action on.\nAnything that we can do to keep the device on, get more information, help them be engaged and then find ways of\nguiding that behavior was really, really interesting and is the framework for the system.\nThen you can start to think about designs how you build your data infrastructure, your insight system, how you process it,\nhow you build the application experience that surfaces it.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4165, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b2e06e8-c9cd-421a-b015-9dcff3ffdb74": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b2e06e8-c9cd-421a-b015-9dcff3ffdb74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "542abdfd-1f6a-4c2e-822f-b2f91dd241e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "221f0956f3ea3622d43af45d976911320b7a451db680828da247113e8601c4f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af11e625-874c-4927-9434-23b8d74a8b8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "155", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "61b636e0f33798363fad234801ffc2143b4c1a2cd328bcf417042cc5fe32ffba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "faa6cfa3-6ed0-4ba8-b09d-8d3ed8180edd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91c7d5fffc3296b9a945cd7636a689c15bf322b842908d56d1a334213977308d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "571c3ed0ec18e5191d7eaeeae7adf2c0dcf4eaf41ff3140f5f1a91d2ea22054e", "text": "The third part was act, so track, understand, and act.

There are people who have medical reasons for the use of our product. We design\ndifferent kinds of experiences. We think about using platforms like phones and ways to push notifications as part of the\nsystem. We think of notifications as a tool for behavior change. We actually start to go map out these things. What is a\nsmart action? Is it real time, does it feel customizable, does it feel progressive, does it help me, is it really tailored to me?\nFor this particular type of user, we'd go out and storyboard. These storyboards go to our design engineering teams. We\nwork together and they actually start to build off of this. What this does for us is it creates a nice set of constraints. My\nexperience has been constraints are really great because they serve as opportunities to resolve, to refine, to simplify, and\npush you to find the right answer that will solve the user problem in the simplest way.\nWe create a lot of those constraints around what we're doing. This is the storyboarding for getting someone to the goal\nand how they do it and what we use, in real time. Then we put in the secondary experiences, which is if we can do this\nand we can fit it in, if it's not too cluttered or confusing we'll put it in. That's a little bit of a snapshot into how we build and\nwe've few minutes left so I'd love to answer any questions.\nAudience Member 1: So let's say you have a product. You have all these features that you want to create. You're about to\nenter to the design process. How do you approach the whole problem? How do you break down how it is going to solve\nthe problem? But then, each design feature is not mutually exclusive. How do you approach it holistically? When you\nhave a number of different features and functions that you are trying to build, how do you look at them on a system level\nrather than in a silo to understand what the tradeoffs are across the entire system?\nHosain Rahman: That's the answer to your question. You do exactly that. You don't think about it in a silo. When it\u2019s a\nsmall team, it's really easy because you all are sitting around the table. You're looking at each other. You are making\nthose decisions in real time. As you get bigger, in larger companies, you have to force communication where everyone is\nin a room and a person says, \"If you build it, if you were to constrain me in this way, I can't get the quality spec that you\nneed me to make.\" And another guy is going to say, \"Well if you do that then I can't fit all of the rhythms in at the battery\nperformance that you want.\"\nWhen you look across the system, everyone has to share what their pains are so you actually understand, \"If I make this\ntrade off, it's going to affect me over here.\" You have to put everyone in a room and start hashing that out. That's what\u2019s on\nthe board and on the walls on everywhere, that's what are we trying to do. Does that trade off still meet it across right\nacross all those, all those different cylos. Because everyone is thinking about the trade off in their bend. They know what\nthey need to accomplish. But again how does that affect the whole, whole thing.

It's not actually a system. There are simple systems. There are complex ones. A\nplane is a very complex system. A car is a very complex system. There are other products we make that are much\nsimpler. A phone is a complex system. An application you should think of as a system. Storage. The front end experience.\nWhat you're doing is connecting. That\u2019s all a system. So that\u2019s more what of what I mean about systems.

This is certainly not\nthe most exciting of the classes, but if you get this right, this is probably the class that helps you avoid the most pain.\nThank you very much for coming.\nCarolynn: Like Sam said, this lecture is about the Mechanics of the Startup. Kirsty and I are going to be talking about the\nbasic legal and accounting issues that your startup may face in the very beginning.\nI was watching Paul Graham's video and at one point he says, \"Founders don't need to know the mechanics of starting a\nstartup.\" And I thought, \"Oh no! That's exactly what Sam titled this lecture.\"\nWhat PG actually says is that founders don't need to know the mechanics in detail. It's very dangerous for founders to get\nbogged down in the details. That's exactly right. Kirsty and I can't give you the details in forty-five minutes anyway.\nOur goal here today is to make sure that you do know better than to form your startup as a Florida, LLC.\nKirsty: As Sam mentioned, we were also worrying that this was going to be pretty boring for you to listen to an Accountant\nand a Lawyer talking. You've had some really amazing founders talking about really interesting things. But like Sam said,\nif you know the basics, you can get yourself set up in the right way, avoid pain, stop worrying about it, and then\nconcentrate on what you actually want to do, which is make your company a success.\nWe refer to this term \"startup\" all the time. In the back of your head, you probably know a \"startup\" has to be a separate\nlegal entity. We're going to talk a bit more about how you actually set that up and what that means.\nYou also probably know that a startup will have assets, IP, inventions, other things, and that the company needs to protect\nthose. So we'll talk a bit more about that and about raising money, hiring employees, and entering into contracts.\nThere are a few other things that you need to talk about when setting up your company which ferret out a few issues\namongst founders. Who's going to be in charge? How much equity is everybody going to own?\nCarolynn: The first thing we're going to talk about is formation. Your startup is going to be a separate legal entity. You\nprobably already know this but the primary purpose for forming a separate legal entity is to protect yourselves from\npersonal liability. If your company ever gets sued, it's not your money in your bank account that the person can take. It's\nthe corporation's.\nThen the question is: where do you form one? Theoretically you have fifty choices, but the easiest place is Delaware. I'm\nsure you're all familiar with that as well. Delaware is in the business of forming corporations. The law there is very clear\nand very settled. It's the standard. The other thing is that investors are very comfortable with Delaware. They already\ninvest in companies that are Delaware corporations. Most of their investments are probably Delaware corporations. So if\nyou are also a Delaware corporation then everything becomes much simpler. There's less diligence for the investor to do.\nYou don't have to have a conversation about whether or not to reincorporate your Washington into Delaware.\nWe had a company at YC about two years ago that was originally formed as an LLC in, I'll say Connecticut. The founders\nhad lawyer friends there who said that this was right way to do it. When they came to YC we said, you need to convert to\nDelaware. The Lawyers in Connecticut did the conversion paperwork and unfortunately they didn't do it right. They made\na very simple mistake, but it was a very crucial mistake. The company was recently raising money, a lot of money, and\nthis mistake was uncovered. The company thought it was a Delaware corporation for a couple of years but in fact it was\nstill a Connecticut LLC. I'll just say this: four different law firms were needed to figure that one out.

Keep it really simple and familiar for yourself. The reason we incorporate all\ncompanies the same way at Y Combinator is because it's easy. Don`t get fancy. Save yourself time and money.\nKirsty: Once you decide that you're going to be a Delaware corporation, how do you actually set that up? It requires a few\ndifferent steps. The first one is really easy. You literally just fax two pieces of paper into Delaware saying we're going to\nset up a corporation. All that does though is create a shell of a company. It doesn't actually do anything within the\ncompany. After that, you then need to complete a set of documents that approve the by-laws of the company. It creates a\nboard of directors. It creates officers of the company. Delaware requires that someone has the title of CEO, President, and\nSecretary.\nAt this point, you also need to complete documents that assign any inventions or any code that you as an individual\ncreate so that the company actually owns that. Remember, at this point it's a really good thing to think about, \"Am I doing\nthis as an individual, or am I doing this on behalf of the company, which is a separate entity.\" You have to maintain that\nsplit in your mind.\nThere are services that can help you get incorporated. You can use a law firm, but there are also other online services\nthat help. The one that we often use with YC companies is called Clerky. They are set up so that all that standard basic\ndocuments are used and they get you set up in a very vanilla way so that you can move on and keep focusing on what\nyou need to do.\nA note on paperwork. You're creating documents. These are really important documents that are going to be setting what\nthe company does and what the company is. It's really important that you actually keep these signed documents in a safe\nplace. It sounds so basic but we get so many founders saying, \"Oh, these are just some documents.\" They have no idea\nwhat they are or where there are. So really, really make sure that you keep them in a safe place. Let's be honest, filing\ndocuments is not the glamorous part of running a startup. The times where this is crucial are going to be high stress times\nin the startup's life. It's likely when the company is raising a big Series A or if the company is being acquired. The\ncompany will have to go through due diligence and there will be lawyers asking for all this stuff. If you don't have it and\nyou don't know where it is, you're making a stressful situation even more stressful.\nThe key thing here is keep those documents in a safe place. Keep them organized. It will make your life so much easier.\nCarolynn: Now we're going to talk about equity. We're going to touch on a couple different things in this section. The first\nthing that we're going to talk about is equity allocation. If your company stock is high, how to divide the pie. You have to\ntalk about this with your co-founders. Why is this important? If you're a solo-founder this isn't important. If you are a team\nof two or more, then this issue is absolutely critical.\nThe first thing that you need to know is that execution has greater value than the idea. What do I mean by that? A lot of\nFounder Teams give way too much credit and therefore a lot of the company's equity to the person who came up with the\nidea for the company. Ideas are obviously very important but they have zero value. Who's ever heard of a billion dollar\npayment for just an idea? Value is created when the whole Founder team works together to execute on an idea.

Said another way, all the founders have to be in it one hundred\npercent. Are they all in it for the long haul? If the expectation at your startup is that each Founder is in it one hundred\npercent, for the long haul, then everything that happened before the formation of the company shouldn't matter. It doesn't\nmatter who thought of the idea, who did the coding, who built the prototype, or which one has an MBA. It will feel better to\nthe whole team if the allocation is equal because the whole team is necessary for execution. The take away on this point:\nin the top YC companies, which we call those with the highest valuations, there are zero instances where the founders\nhave a significantly disproportionate equity split.\nKirsty: You've had the conversation about to split the equity but then what? We talk to many founders who are actually\nsurprised that they have do something in order to own this stock. They think that talking about it is actually enough. This is\nanother situation where you have to think about you as an individual versus you as a representative of the company. And\nif you equate this to a large company, if you worked at Google and were told that, as part of your compensation package,\nyou would be receiving shares, you would expect to sign something to get those shares. If you didn't, you would be\nthinking, \"What's going on here?\" It's the same thing with a small company.\nIn this case the document that you're signing is a stock purchase engagement. You as an individual buy the shares from\nthe company. In any situation, if you're buying something there's a two way transaction. In this case you're getting shares\nin return for either a cash payment or for contributing IP or inventions or code to the company so that the company\nactually owns everything that you've done in the past. We also refer to that stock as being restricted because it vests over\ntime. We're going to cover that next, in more detail. As a result of the stock being restricted and vesting, there's one very\ncrucial piece of paper that we talk about until we're blue in the face to everybody because there's actually no way to go\nback and fix this. This is one of the things that has blown up deals in the past. We've seen companies who haven't filed\nwhat's called an 83(b) Election, and deals have blown up. I'm not going to go into detail about the 83(b) election, but it\naffects your individual taxes and it affects the company\u2019s taxes. It can have a big impact. The main things here are sign\nthe paper work, sign the Stock Purchase Agreements, sign the 83(b) Election, and make sure that you actually have proof\nthat you sent that in. If you don't have the proof it just goes into a black hole at the IRS. Investors and acquirers will walk\naway from a deal if you can't prove that.\nCarolynn: The next thing we are going talk about is vesting. I imagine that many of you are familiar with vesting, but just in\ncase, vesting means that you get full ownership of your stock over a specific period of time. We're talking about the stock\nthat Kirsty just said. You bought your stock of your company and you own it and you get to vote, but if you leave before\nthis vesting period is over, then the company can get those unvested shares back. When your hear restricted stock, it\nmeans that the stock is subject to vesting. The IRS speak for this is, \"Shares that are subject to forfeiture.\"\nWhat should a typical vesting period be? In Silicon Valley the so called standard vesting period is four years with a one\nyear cliff. This means that after one year, the Founder vests in or fully owns twenty-five percent of the shares. Then the\nremaining shares vest monthly over the next three years. Here's an example. Founder buys stock on Christmas day, let's\nsay, and then quits the company on the following Thanksgiving. So before the year has passed. In that case the Founder\nleaves with zero shares, because the cliff period hasn't been met. If the Founder quits the day after the next Christmas, so\na year and day later, he or she is vesting in twenty-five percent of the shares.

How? They just write the Founder a check. That's how the Founder brought it. It's the same price per share\nthat the Founder paid, so it's simply giving the Founder his or her money back.\nSo why have vesting? Why would founders do this to themselves?They're doing this to their own shares. The number one\nreason why vesting is important has to do with founders leaving the company. If you didn't have vesting and a founder\nleaves, a huge chunk of the equity ownership leaves with or her. Obviously that is not fair to the founders left behind.\nWe're actually going to talk about this a little bit more when we get to the the \"Founder Employment\" slide.

If the Founder can walk away with his or her full ownership at any point and time, then why\nwould you stay and grind away? Startups are hard.\nDo solo founders need vesting? They do and the reason is because the skin of the game concept applies to solo\nfounders as well. Investors want to see all founders, even solo founders, incentivized to stay with at the company for a\nlong time. The other reason that solo founders should put vesting on their shares is to set an example for employees. You\ncan imagine it would be inappropriate for a Founder to tell an employee that he or she has to have four year vesting on\nhis or her shares but the founder doesn't think he or she needs any on their own shares. It's a culture point. A founder\nwho has vesting on his or her shares then sets the tone for the company by saying, \"We're all in it for the long hall. We are\nall vesting on our shares. We're doing this together.\"\nVesting aligns incentives among the founders if they all have to stick it out and grow the company before they get any of\nthat company. Investors don't want put money in a company where the founders can quit whenever they feel like it and\nstill have a big equity ownership stake in that company.\nKirsty: Moving on. We've now got a beautifully formed corporation in Delaware. Everyone has their stock. It's all in the\nplain vanilla standard paperwork. Then what? The next stage of a company's life is to raise money. We know that you\nalready heard a lot from a lot investors and from founders in this set of classes. They've been talking about the tactics of\nhow to raise money but what about the paperwork? What about when somebody actually agrees to invest?\nIn terms of logistics, in very simple terms there are two ways to raise money. Either the price is set for the money that\ncomes in or the price isn't set. By price we mean the valuation of the company. Rounds can actually be called anything.\nPeople can name them whatever they want, but generally when you hear the term seed round, it mean that the price has\nnot been set. Anything that's a Series A or Series B is something where the price has been set.\nNot setting the price is the most straight forward, fast route to getting money. The way that this is done is through\nconvertible notes or safes. Again, this is a two way transaction. It's a piece of paper that says, for example, that an investor\nis paying one hundred thousand dollars now and in return has the right to receive stock at a future date when the price is\nset by investors in a priced round. It\u2019s important to note that at the time that paperwork is set, that investor is not a\nshareholder and therefore doesn't have any voting rights in the company. They will have other rights which Carolynn is\ngoing to talk about separately.\nOf course investors want something in return for putting in money at the earliest, riskiest stage of the company's life. This\nis where the concept of a valuation cap comes in, which I'm sure many of you heard mentioned before. The documents\nfor an unpriced round set a cap for the conversion into shares that's not the current valuation of the company. It's an upper\nbound on the valuation used in future to calculate how many shares that investor is going to get. For example, take an\ninvestor that invests one hundred thousand dollars on a safe with a five million dollar cap. If a year later the company\nraises a priced round with a valuation of twenty million dollars, then the early investor would have a much lower price per\nshare. About a quarter. Therefore their hundred thousand dollars would buy them approximately four times more shares\nthan an investor that was coming and putting in a hundred thousand in that Series A priced round. That's where they get\ntheir reward for being in early.\nAgain, this is a situation where you need to make sure you have the signed documents. Services like Clerky can help\nwith that. They have very standard documents that most of our YC companies use to raise money.\nA couple of other things to think about when you are raising money, um.

Often those are the investors\nthat cause the most problems going forward because they don't understand how this is a long term gain. They get to the\npoint where they're sitting thinking, \"Hmm. I could actually do with that money back because I need a new kitchen.\" Or,\n\"This startup investing is not actually as exciting as all the TV shows and movies made it out to be.\" That causes problems\nfor the company. They're asking for their money back. Be aware that you should be raising money from people who are\nsophisticated and know what they're doing. The term that you'll hear that refers to these people are that they are\naccredited investors.\nThe main point here is keep it simple. Raise your money using standard documents. Make sure that you have people\nwho understand what they are getting into and understand what you're getting into in terms of future dilution.\nCarolynn: Ok. You're raising money. You understand what you're selling. You figured out the price. You got down the\nlogistics that Kirsty just described. What you may find is that you don't understand some of the terms and terminology that\nyour investors are using. This is ok, but you do have a burden to go and figure it out. Don't assume that just because you\nhave agreed on the valuation of the price, that all the other stuff doesn't matter. It does matter. You need to know how\nthese terms are going to impact your company in the long run. At Y Combinator, Kirsty and I hear founders say all the time\n\"I didn't know what that was. I didn't know what I was signing. I didn't know I agreed to that!\" The burden is on you to figure\nthis stuff out.\nWe're going to go over four common investor requests. The first one is a board seat. Some investors will ask for seat on\nyour company\u2019s board of directors. The investor usually wants to be a director either because he or she wants to keep\ntabs on their money or because he or she really thinks they can help you run your business. You have to be careful about\nadding an investor to your board. In most cases you want to say no. Otherwise make sure it's a person who is really going\nto add value. Having money is very valuable but someone who helps with strategy and direction is priceless. So choose\nwisely.\nThe other things is advisers. They are so many people who want to give advice to startups. Few people actually give\ngood advice. Once an investor has given your company money, that person should be a de facto adviser but without any\nofficial title and more importantly without the company having to give anything extra in return for the advice.\nAt Y Combinator, we've noticed that whenever a startup manages to garner a celebrity investor, the celebrity almost\nalways asks to be an adviser. We have a company that provides on-demand bodyguard services. An NBA basketball\nplayer invested and asked to be an adviser and then asked to be given shares of common stock in exchange for adviser\nservices. The service that this person had in mind was to introduce this company to other professional basketball players\nwho might want to use an on-demand bodyguard. This celebrity just made a big investment, shouldn't he want to help the\ncompany succeed? Why does he need something extra? All investors who can help should do so. Asking for additional\nshares is just an investor looking for a freebie.\nNext we're going to talk about pro-rata rights. Very simply, pro-rata rights are the right to maintain your percentage\nownership in a company by buying more shares in the company in the future. Pro-rata rights are a way to avoid dilution.\nDilution in this context means owning less and less of the company each time the company sells more stock to other\ninvestors.\nThis is a really basic example, but say an early investor buys shares of preferred stock and ends up owning three percent\nof the company once the financing has closed. The company raises another round of financing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4291, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1caf1bbb-92fd-4601-aed4-22dc2a96e5f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1caf1bbb-92fd-4601-aed4-22dc2a96e5f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66eb5835-8851-430e-8ef1-31e29f7b051a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "4939ac5df89bf4f3d99ee48d0a91257aab4194df3c0a0b1065f8004255939b9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa7d7338-e17a-435a-9b04-46b5f11fccdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d49edce98339150019b5ce08e59e6690a25cab8894a19aec3a8fad928e99e8c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "270b11eb-718a-45b5-bea1-2b4dde1d21b9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee3761164f5ecdba38d37787b31bb4168912f97f0810fabb25d2024bcb2cf68d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "01dc22515139ad9aa0b8e04e63c07cbe4fd59650e37cc421b1592df614c8ae41", "text": "This celebrity just made a big investment, shouldn't he want to help the\ncompany succeed?

You're welcome to buy this many\nshares in the new round to keep your ownership at approximately three percent.\"\nPro-rata rights are a very common request from investors. They are not necessarily a bad thing, but as a founder you\nabsolutely need to know how pro-rata rights work. Especially because the corollary to an investor having pro-rata rights", "start_char_idx": 3475, "end_char_idx": 4750, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "270b11eb-718a-45b5-bea1-2b4dde1d21b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "270b11eb-718a-45b5-bea1-2b4dde1d21b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a11c6eef-f8db-4f32-8e8c-9095104fec0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "8d11c4762c58c426b167845287e6d85621b2437e90154983a994ae7ae2d733ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1caf1bbb-92fd-4601-aed4-22dc2a96e5f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "162", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "01dc22515139ad9aa0b8e04e63c07cbe4fd59650e37cc421b1592df614c8ae41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f876829-5a8d-4b8d-8046-8d2c2ff356c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "08a30ff782ba79c557225277630398d378ed71fe068e2271710bc7f070fe39d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ee3761164f5ecdba38d37787b31bb4168912f97f0810fabb25d2024bcb2cf68d", "text": "to avoid dilution is that founders typically suffer greater dilution.\nThe final thing is information rights. Investors almost always want contractual information rights to get certain information\nabout your company. Giving periodic information and status updates is not a bad thing. At YC we encourage companies\nto give monthly updates to their investors because it's a great opportunity to ask for help with introductions or help with\nhiring. That kind of thing. You have to be really careful about overreach. Any investor saying they want a monthly budget\nor weekly update, that's not ok.\nThe takeaway here is that just because the type of financing and the valuation has been negotiated doesn't mean that\neverything else is unimportant. You need to know everything about your financing.\nKirsty: Moving on to after you've raised money. The company bank account probably has more zeros in it then you've\never seen in your life. Then what? This is where you actually start incurring business expenses. Business expenses are\nthe cost of carrying out your business. Paying employees, paying rent for an office, hosting costs, the cost of acquiring\ncustomers, that kind of thing. Business expenses are important because they get deducted on the company's tax return to\noffset any revenues that are made to lower the taxes that the company pays. On the flip side, if the company incurs a a\nnon-business expense that is not deductible on the tax return, that can increase the profits of the company that have to\npay tax on them.\nAgain, this is a separation issue. The company will have its own bank account, out of which the company's expenses\nshould be paid. Um, again think about this from a, from a large company, if you were working at Google, you would not\nuse a Google credit card to buy a tooth brush and tooth paste.\nRemember that the investors gave you this money. They trusted you with a huge amount of money. They want you to use\nthat money to make the company a success. It's not your money for you to spend how you please. Believe me, we've had\nsome horror stories of founders who've take that approach. We had one founder who took investor money and went to\nVegas. By his Facebook photos, boy did he have a good time. Needless to say he's no longer with the company. This is\nstealing from investors.\nThe concept of business expenses can get a little bit blurry, especially in the early days when you're working in your\napartment twenty four hours a day. The way to think about it is, \"If an investor asked me what I'd spent their money on and\nI had to give them a line by line break down, would I be embarrassed about any of those lines?\" If you would, it's probably\nnot a business expense.\nThe other thing to bear in mind is that you're busy running your company at ninety miles an hour, so you don't have to\nnecessarily think about the book keeping and accounting at that point. However, it's crucial to keep the receipts so when\nyou do engage a book keeper or a CPA to prepare your tax returns, they can figure out what are business expenses and\nwhat aren't business expenses. They're going need your help as a founder to do this. The way make your involvement as\nsmall as possible is to keep those documents in a safe place, so you can easily refer to them.\nIf you remember nothing else, do not go to Vegas on investors\u2019 money. Spend that money wisely.\nCarolynn: In this section we're going to hit a couple topics in this section. The first one is \"Founder Employment.\" Why are\nwe talking about founder employment? As we said already, the company is separate legal entity. It exists completely\nseparately from you as founders. As prestigious as we think the title founder is, you're really just a company employee\nand founders have to be paid. Working for free is against the law and founders should not let their company take on this\nliability. You wouldn't work for free anywhere else, so why is your startup an exception? Companies have to pay payroll\ntaxes. We had a YC company that completely blocked their payroll taxes for three years.

Why? Unpaid wages become\nleverage for the fired founder to get something that he or she wants from the company. Typically that is vesting\nacceleration. The fired founder says, \"Hey. My lawyer says you broke the law by not paying me. If you pay me and you\ngive me some shares that I am actually not really entitled to, I'll sign a release and make all this ugliness go away.\" If\nyou're the remaining co-founders, you're probably like, \"Sounds like a good deal.\" Now you have a disgruntled person\nwho owns a piece of your company and, even worse, the remaining workers are working for that ex-founder. They are\nbuilding all the value in the company and the ex-founder who got fired is sitting there with all their shares going, \u201cThat\u2019s\nright. Make it valuable.\"\nThe take away here is avoid problems by paying yourself. Paying your payroll taxes and thinking of your co-founders\nwages like a marital pre-nup.\nKirsty: As the founders, you are going to need to hire employees. Much has been said in previous classes about how to\nfind those people, about what makes a good fit, and about how to make them really productive employees. When you\nactually find somebody, how do you hire them? What's involved? Employment is governed by a huge raft of laws.\nTherefore, it's important to get this right. It's again the nitty gritty stuff that, as long as you know the basics, you can\nprobably keep yourself out of most situations. As soon as things get complicated, you need to get yourself involved with a\nspecialist.\nthe first thing you need to do is figure out if the person is an employee or a contractor. There are subtle differences to this\nclassification. this is important to get right because the IRS takes a big interest in this. If they think you got it wrong they\nwill come after you with fines.\nBoth an employee and a contractor will require documents that assign any IP that they create to the company. That's\nobviously really important. The form of the document is very different for each type of person and the method of payments\nare very different. Generally a contractor will be able to set their own work hours and location and they will be given a\nproject where there is an end result. How they actually get to that will not be set. They'll be using their own equipment and\nthey won't really have any say in the day to day running of the company or the strategy going forward. A contractor will\nsign a consulting agreement. When the company pays them, the company doesn't hold any taxes on their behalf. That\nresponsibility is on the individual. At the end of the year, the company will provide what's called a form 1099 to the\nindividual and to the IRS, which they use to prepare their personal tax returns.\nThe opposite side of this is an employee. An employee will also sign some form of IP assignment agreement, but when\nthe company pays them, the company will withhold taxes from their salary. The company is responsible for paying those\ntaxes to the relevant state or federal authorities. At the end of the year the employee receives a W2 form, which will then\nbe used to prepare their personal tax returns.\nThe founders need to be paid. So do employees. It isn't enough to just say, \"Well, I am paying them in stock. That can be\ntheir compensation.\" They need to be paid at least minimum wage. In San Francisco, which has a slightly higher\nminimum wage than California as a whole, that works out to about two thousand dollars a month. It's not a huge amount\nbut it can add up.\nThere's are other things that you need to make sure you have if you have employees. The first thing is that you're required\nto have workers compensation insurance, especially if you're in New York. The New York authorities that look after this\nwill send really threatening letters saying, \"You owe fifty thousand dollars in fines because your one employee that's\nbeing paid minimum wage has not paid the twenty dollars a month of workers compensation fees.\" It is really important\nthat you set that up. The other thing that is important is that you need to see proof that the employee is authorized to work\nin the US.\nFounders are not payroll experts and nobody expects you to be one.

Use a payroll service provider and make sure that you understand the basics of employment.\nCarolynn: Somebody at YC once said, \"You're not a real founder until you've had to fire somebody.\" Why is that?\nBecause firing people is really hard. It's hard for a lot of reasons, including that founders tend to hire their friends. They\ntend to hire former co-workers or they get close to their employees because working at a startup is really intense. But in\nevery company there's going to be an employee that doesn't work out and firing this employee makes a founder a real\nprofessional because he or she has to do what is right for the company instead of what is easy. Best practices for how to\nfire someone: number one, fire quickly. Don't let a bad employee linger. It's so easy to put off a difficult conversation but\nthere is only downside to procrastination. If a toxic employee stays around too long, good employees may quit. If the\nemployee is actually screwing up the job, you may lose business or users.\nNumber two , communicate effectively. Don't rationalize. Don't make excuses. Don't equivocate about why you are firing\nthe employee. Make clear direct statements. Don't apologize. \"We're letting you go,\" not, \"I'm so sorry your sales didn't\ntake off this quarter, blah, blah, blah.\" Fire the employee face to face and ideally with a third party present.\nNumber three, pay all wages and accrued vacation immediately. This is a legal requirement that we don't debate or\nnegotiate.\nNumber four, cut off access to digital systems. Once an employee is out the door, cut off physical and digital access.\nControl information in the cloud. Change passwords. We had a situation at YC where one founder had access to the\ncompany's GitHub account and held the password hostage when his co-founders try to fire him.\nNumber five, if the terminated employee has any invested shares, the company should repurchase them right away. The\ntakeaway here is that, surprising as this may sound, one of the hallmarks of a really effective founder is how well he or\nshe handles employee terminations.\nKirsty: The basic tenant to all of this is keep it simple. Do all the standard stuff and keep it organized. Make sure you know\nwhat you're doing. Equity ownership is really important, so make sure you are thinking about the future rather than the\nthree months of the history of the company. Stock doesn't buy itself, so make sure you do the paperwork.\nMake sure you actually know about the financing documents that you're signing. It's not enough to just say, \"I'll take your\nhundred K.\" You and the employees need to be paid. Everybody needs to assign IP to the company. If the company does\nnot own that IP, there is no value in the company. If an employee must be fired, do it quickly and professionally.\nWe didn't mention knowing your key metrics. At any time you should know the cash position, you should know your burn\nrate, you should know when that cash is going to run out so you can talk to your investors. A lot of running a startup is\nfollowing the rules and taking it seriously. It's not all the glamorous bits that we see in movies and TV shows. You do have\nto take that seriously.\nAudience Member #1: How would you advise searching for an accountant and when in the process do you need one?\nKirsty: There are two different things. There is a book keeper and there is a CPA, an accountant. Generally book keepers\nwill categorize all your expenses and CPAs will prepare your tax returns. In the very early days it's probably fine for the\nfounders to just be able to see the bank statements and see those expenses coming out. Tax returns have to be prepared\nannually, so at some point in that first year of the company's life, some service is going to need to be engaged to do that.\nIt's not worth the founders time to do it. There are services available like inDinero which try to make things as effortless as\npossible from the founders's point of view. You do need to get a CPA at some point because you need to file your annual\ntax returns for the company.\nAudience Member #1: How do you find one?\nKirsty: Finding one is tough. The best is through recommendations. With any kind of specialist, a CPA or an accountant or\na lawyer, it's always best to use people who are used to dealing with startups.

Well, actually it does cost a little\nbit.\nCarolynn: Incorporating online using a service like Clerky is inexpensive. In the hundreds, not in the thousands. You don't\nneed a lawyer for that part. When you actually need to hire a lawyer depends on what business you are starting and how\ncomplicated it is. Do you have a lot of privacy policies, is HIPPA involved?

I'm the CEO of Clever. What I want to talk today is about sales. I graduated college, where I studied math\nand statistics, and thought I was destined for this world of finance. I was about to start at a hedge fund, but at the last\nsecond a friend of mine roped me into joining his startup to do sales, which I knew nothing about. I had to figure it out on\nthe fly. I spent a couple of years there figuring out sales for this very early stage company. When it came time to start\nClever, I started Clever with two co-founders who were very technical and very product oriented. We wanted to build this\nproduct for schools and I thought that experience would have no relevancy whatsoever. It turns out that what I picked up\nwhile doing sales at this previous job has been a huge part of what\u2019s made Clever grow so quickly today.\nA quick background on Clever: we build software for schools. We are an app platform for developers that is used today by\nabout one in five schools in America. We started it about two years ago.\nSales has been key. I want to use this time to share some of the things that have worked for me along the way. Of course,\nthere's a million ways to do this, so you'll find what works for you.\nFirst I want to start about how I used to perceive sales. A lot of people see sales as having mystique around it. It's people\nwho are articulate and impossibly charming. They have these killer closing lines that they use. This is how I saw sales. I\nthink this is how a lot of founders I talk to see sales because they say things to me like, \"You know, we're just going to\nwork on the product and build a great product and then when it's finally finished, we're going hire the sales people.\" What\nI've learned is that when it comes to \"hiring the sales people,\" as a founder, the reality is that it's you. Paul Graham likes to\ntalk about how there's two things you should be doing at any point in time when you're starting your company. You should\nbe either talking to your users or building your product. The talking to your users part, that's selling. This is intimidating to\nsome people because they're like, \"I've never done sales, and I wouldn't even know where to begin.\" It turns out that as a\nfounder you have some unique advantages that make it possible for you to be really, really good at sales. One of those is\nyour passion for the product and what you're building. The second is your knowledge of the industry and the problem that\nyou're solving. Those two things actually totally trump sales experience from what I've seen.\nThis is actually my co-founder doing sales. This is what sales looks like in the very early stage of a startup. It's not Don\nDrapers. It's a lot of calls like these. This is something that even as a founder who has never done it before, is very easy to\ndo but you have to commit yourself. What we did at Clever is we dedicated one founder, which was me, to peel off and\nsay, \"Ok, Tyler you gotta go figure this out and work on this full time because it's so important to our business.\"\nThe first thing that everybody knows about sales is it's a funnel. You have these different stages of the funnel and you\nmove your customers through it. A pretty common category is the prospecting category. We were trying to figure out who's\neven interested. Then you're having a lot of conversations, which is the second level of the funnel. Then you're finding out\nwho's really serious and you want to close them and sign the deal. Then you're in the promised land of revenue. I thought\nit would be interesting to talk about each stage and a couple of strategies that we've used at Clever that have worked\nwell, so that these aren't abstract but hopefully lessons you can use at your start up.\nProspecting is the process of figuring out who will even take your call.

It might seem discouraging that only 2.5 percent of companies are your potential\ncustomers or would even consider buying from a startup that has no users and no revenue, but I found the opposite.

You have to talk to a\nlot of people.\nIn the early days Clever, this was my job. In the first two months of YC I reached out to over 400 companies trying to to get\nthem to take a call and talk to us about what we were building.\nThere are three methods that I have found to be most successful in prospecting and getting these people. One is your\npersonal network. That's obvious. I'm not going to spend any time there. Another one is conferences, which is surprising\nto a lot of people. The one that people are most familiar with is cold email. When I say conferences, people think I am\ntalking about CES or E3. The kind of conferences where sales happen look more like this. In the early days we would go\nto a lot of these because you've got to go to where your users are. If you're selling to CIO's and there happens to be a\ngathering of them at a hotel in Milwaukee, guess what? That's where you should be. So we went to conferences like\nthese. We got the attendee list in advance. We'd email every single person in advance and try set up meetings so when\nwe got there every single minute of that trip was was well spent. It was huge in Clever's early days. This is where met all\nof our earliest customers.\nThe second thing I mentioned is cold email. A lot of people don't know how to write cold emails. It's actually easy and the\nkey is not to write a lot. Your email should be concise. This is an email template that I used early on. You're welcome to\ncopy it but it's really short. Here's who I am. Here's what I'm building. I'd love to talk to you about this. Could we find time\ntomorrow? It's really easy and you can customize this for every business you want to sell to. Find out who the right person\nis to send it to and you can send out quite a few of these.\nThat's prospecting. The reason this so important is because you have to build that first layer of the funnel.\nThen you have to get them to take your call. This is another place where a lot of founders have questions about what to\nactually do. The biggest thing to take away, in fact if you ONLY take away one thing from this presentation today this\nshould be it, is when you get them on the phone, remember to shut up. That's really surprising to people. So many\nfounders, when I help them with their first sales pitch, would finally get somebody on the phone who wanted to talk to\nthem about their product and they'd be so proud of this thing that they'd been building for the last three months that all\nthey wanted to do was get on the phone and talk about every feature and talk about why it's the greatest thing in the\nworld. I have that temptation too. It's just part of being really proud of something.\nIt turns out that if you watch the best sales people, the top one percent, or you have a chance to listen in on a call with\nsome of those people, the most surprising thing is how little talking they do. In fact I've seen calls where the sales person\ntold me their goal was to only spend 30 percent of the call talking and have 70 percent of the call be the other person.\nThey would ask a lot of questions. They'd say things like, \"Why did you even agree to take my call today?\" \"This problem\nthat we're talking about solving for you, how do you solve it today?\" \"What would your ideal solution look like?\" They're\nnot doing the talking. They're doing everything they can to find out what this person needs and hopefully understand their\nproblem even better than they do. That's what really great sales is.

Here's a lot of different steps that you go\nthrough: emailing somebody, not getting a response and emailing them back. Calling them, leaving a voice mail. Having\na pricing call. There are probably sixty things on this slide that could be steps for closing a deal. These aren't random\nthings -- this was the second deal Clever ever signed. These are all the different steps that we had to do in order to get\nthis done. You can see there's a lot of really embarrassing things up there. I emailed somebody and they didn't respond. I\nemailed them again and they didn't respond. I emailed them again. This was from somebody who wanted to buy our\nproduct. Isn't that crazy? That surprises a lot of people. I see so many founders who think they have a great call with\nsomeone and send an email, but don't hear back. They say, \"Oh that person might not be interested.\" Well guess what?\nThis is what it looks like in the best case. You really have to have kind this unhuman and unreasonable willingness to\nfollow up and drive things to closure.", "start_char_idx": 3187, "end_char_idx": 5180, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c00719aa-4f6b-486c-a184-fa2dd08b5205": {"__data__": {"id_": "c00719aa-4f6b-486c-a184-fa2dd08b5205", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "71c6d61b-5b67-4355-a914-c626d4023a2f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "71a6343298da8280100256ed14685a563576580df2965c057585f1ac5e15cec1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43d05aae-7e67-45e4-a13a-fefdb1d48ba7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e60b3b906212435e4c8c9b3631dd579a4421c1e89b04f524df8cd0ef19f49d2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d441c2e-f2ad-4ebe-9ca4-fae9a41a5bec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0343c52057f012d0dc37fcf138a7332be6fcb7fd94aa47c60371fb2a34531702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "859a405f90cfb04c9f3f8d620b08bbda0f1131570ea3c6b9f39b779ee22cd7c2", "text": "I qualify with that with one thing which is to say when starting a company your time is extremely valuable because it's your\nonly resource. You couldn't possibly do this for every single person who might buy your product. Your goal should be to\nget people to a yes or no as quickly as you can. Where you die is if you have a thousand maybes and sometimes I talk to\nfounders who say, \"Oh yeah I have this great pipeline of a hundred people who have expressed interest in our product.\"\nThe maybes are what kill you. If you can get to a yes or a no, in some ways a no is even better than a maybe because it\nallows you to move on and focus somebody who might be a yes.\nSo, have a super human level of follow up and ambition, but make sure you're focusing it on the right pieces.\nAlright, so you've talked to a ton of people. You've had all these phone calls. You've followed up with them to the point\nwhere they know you're not going away and they've got to sign an agreement. This final step is something if you haven't\ndone before it might seem hard but it's actually really simple. It's called red lining. You'll send over an agreement and\ntheir lawyers will mark it up. Your lawyers will also mark it up and you kind of go back and forth. If you're part of YC this is\nreally easy because YC has standard template agreements that they give you so you can just use those. But if you\nweren't part of YC you have to figure this out on your own.\nOne of the things that I am really excited about is as part of this presentation, YC has agreed to open source their deal\ndocuments. The documents that YC founders use are going to be available to everybody. So this should never be a\nbarrier to anyone who wants to do sales for their start up. You've got some great documents. The other place where so\nmany smart people go wrong is they don't remember what their goal is. Your goal is to sign some deals, get some\nreference customers, get some validation, and get some revenue. If you don't do that, your startup is toast.\nIn light of that it's really surprising how many smart people will want to do ten rounds of document review over the most\nminor points because of pride. Whatever. Make sure the agreement is the way you want it but then sign and move on. I've\nseen founders spend month quibbling over some indemnification clauses. Their business would have been way better off\nif they'd just signed the deal and moved on to the next one. That's one trap you can fall into.\nAnother trap that I see founders struggle with a lot is they're talking to a company who says, \"I will use your product but I\njust need one more feature.\" Or they say, \"You know I'd love to use your product but it doesn't have this one feature. So\nwe're just not ready.\" To most people, especially if you're ambitious, when somebody says that to you, what you want to\nthink is, \"Oh. I can build that feature and then they're going to use my product.\" The problem is it almost never works that\nway. Somebody telling you that they want to use your product but it's missing this one feature, I would almost map that to\na pass in your mind. Nine times out of ten if you actually build that feature and go back to them, there will be one more\nfeature or some other reason that they're not using the product.\nIf somebody says to you, \"There's this one thing that's preventing us from using your product.\" I would do one of two\nthings. One say, \"Well that's great! Let's sign an agreement and we'll put in the agreement that we're going to build this\nfeature.\" In which case, if you build it you're off to the races. More commonly, what we did at Clever was we would say,\n\"That's great. We're going to wait to see if we hear that demand from more customers.\" Once you have a lot of customers\nrequesting it, then you should build it. Then you don't have to worry about doing something that's a one off, which is what\nyou really want to avoid.\nThe other trap I would highly recommend you try to avoid is the free trial trap.

You need validation. You need users. You need commitment. Free trials get you none of those things. You do\nall this work and if you end up with a free trial, unfortunately you haven't made as much progress as you think, it's actually\nterrible. You think you've made progress but at the end of the free trial you\u2019re going to have to sell them all over again.\nThe way I handle this that has worked really well is that when somebody says, \"Can I get a free trial?\" you say, \"We don't\ndo free trials. We do annual agreements and what we'll do is for the first 30 or 60 days, if for any reason you're not happy,\nyou can opt out.\" That's a way to get you the things that you need while giving them the comfort that they might need to\ntake a chance on a startup. That minor change actually makes a night and day difference when you're thinking about\nthese things.\nAlright, so you've prospected. You've had a lot of conversations. Now you've closed people.

You worked out the free trials. You're on your way to your first sales. Early on, you can think of sales as just\nlike any other thing at a startup. You don't have to do things at scale. In fact you can purposely do unscalable things to try\nand get early customers. That's the fun part. The other thing that is important to keep in mind is once you've done this\nenough, what you should start thinking about is what aspects of this are repeatable. What aspects are we going to scale\nfurther? Christoph Janz wrote this really great blog post online about the five ways to build a hundred million dollar\ncompany. He talks about how he can have a thousand customers buy a product that costs a hundred thousand dollars.\nOr he can have ten thousand customers buy a product that cost ten thousand dollars. Or he can have a hundred\nthousand customers by a product that cost a thousand dollars. Even though you don't need to know on day one which\nbucket you're going to fall into, most companies do fall into one of these buckets. If you want to be in the elephant\ncategory of a hundred thousand dollar product, you're going to have a really high touch sales cycle. That's Salesforce.\nThat's Workday. If you think that you're going to be a rabbit and sell products for a thousand dollars a year and your sales\nprocess involves flying out to see them, and eight demos, and three months of redlining, then you probably have to\nrethink something.\nI see a lot of startups who want to be rabbits that don't think about how to do it in a scalable way. That's one area where\nyou can get under water or it just forces you to increase your prices.\nThis is how I think about different businesses. It will be helpful for you when you get started and once you've done sales\nto say, \"Ok, where am I?\" The corollary to that is, \"How do I have to price my product to be a viable business?\"\nThose are some of the things I figured out building sales at a few different companies, specifically on this very narrow\nstage of zero to one million. After you get to one million, you'll find there's a million blog posts about how to get from five\nmillion to fifty million or ten million to a hundred million, but not the zero to one step. I wanted to focus the presentation on\nthat because there's not as much written about it and it is something that I think is very opaque to our founders. I figured\nthis out just by doing it and I'm confident that if you're starting a company you can too. If for whatever reason you would\nlike to join a startup that's figured it out and hone your skills and hone your craft, we are hiring at Clever. That's an option.\nIf you do want start your own company and you have questions about sales, I put my email address up here. Feel free to\nreach out at any time. I am happy to help.\nThank you.\nSam: Thank you very much! That was awesome! Now we're going talk about a little more about how to raise money.\nMichael Seibel is first going to talk about how you give a pitch and then Qasar will do investor role playing.\nQasar: Yeah, so this isn't mind blowingly new. It really is a basic blocking attack. And the one point we wanted to make\nbefore we get started is we actually don't spend a lot of time at YC focusing on this. The main reason is the best way you\ncan make your pitch better is to improve your company. If you - if you have traction and your product is doing well - these\nconversations are like the investors want to see you succeed. If you remember anything, it's make your company better\nand the pitch will be easier.\nSam: We're going to spend the time in three kinds of sections.

We are going to do Q&A at the end.\nWe'll save five minutes. If there is something we don't cover please write down your questions and we'll go through them.\nMichael: My name is Michael Seibel.

That's basically what you have to do as a\nfounder.\nWe're going to go over four things. The first is your 30 second pitch. You need to be armed with this constantly.

People with whom you need to get a little bit deeper. Notice\nthat's where I stop. A lot of people practice ten/thirty minute pitches or hour pitches. That's all garbage. You can get\neverything you need done in two minutes. One thing I like to tell founders is the more you talk, the more you have an\nopportunity to say something that people don't like. Talk less and it will probably be better.\nI want to tell you about when to fundraise because I think a lot of companies get this a little bit wrong. And then quickly\nhow to to set up investor meetings.\nThe 30 second pitch is so simple. It's three sentences. You can take your time. You can breathe when you do this. You\ndon't have to get that much information out. The first is one sentence on what your company does. Everyone I meet for the\nfirst time screws this up. You have to be able to do it in a way that is simple and straight forward, that requires no further\nquestioning on my part. You have to assume I know nothing. Literally nothing about anything. This is how you make it\nsuper simple. What we tell people is apply the Mom test. If in one sentence you cannot tell your mom what you do, then\nrework the sentence. There is a one sentence explanation that your mom or your dad is going to understand. So really,\nreally start there. It's ok if you use basic language. It's ok if you say, \"Hey we're Airbnb and we allow you to rent out the\nextra room in your house.\" That's simple! You don't have to say, \"We're Airbnb and we're a marketplace for space.\" I don't\nknow what that is! That's going to require more time. Use simple language, it's very important.\nThe second is in a multi-billion dollar market, it's pretty simple to do this. You know Airbnb might say, \"How big is the hotel\nmarket? How big is the vacation rental market? How big is the online hotel booking market?\" These are simple numbers\nto look up on Google. It makes an investor understand, \"Oh wait. If we're big, if we really blow this company up, it could be\nworth billions of dollars.\" Don't skip this up. Second sentence. How big is your market?\nThird sentence, how much traction do you have? Ideally this sentence is saying something on the order of, \"We launched\nin January and we're growing 30 percent month over month. We have this number of sales. This amount of revenue. This\nnumber of users.\" Very simple. If you can't speak to traction because you're prelaunch, you need to convince the investor\nthat you're moving extremely quickly. \"The team started working in January. By March we launched a Beta. By April we\nlaunched our product.\" Convince the investor that you guys are moving fast and that this isn't some long slog. You guys\naren't thinking about this like a big corporation. You're thinking about it like a startup where you can move fast and make\nmistakes. That\u2019s all you have to do in 30 seconds. Three sentences. From that basis you should be able to start a\nconversation about your company. From that basis I understand exactly what you do. You have no idea how valuable it is\nto be able to explain to someone what you do in 30 seconds. Internalize that. If you take nothing else away, that's going to\nhelp you.\nOk. Two minute pitch. Now you got someone you actually have to convince of something. Maybe even someone you\nhave to ask for money. So I like to add four additional components. And these also go by very quick. The first is unique\ninsight. Now if you talk to VC's they'll say stuff like, \"What's your secret sauce? What's your competitive advantage? What's\nunique insight?\" It's all the same thing. When I think about unique insight, what I think about is here's your opportunity to\ntell me something that I don't know. Here's your opportunity to tell me something that the biggest players in the market\nyou're trying to enter don't understand.

Here's your opportunity to tell me something that the biggest players in the market\nyou're trying to enter don't understand. Or don't do well. This is the AHA moment and you better have it down in two\nsentences. The AHA moment. So you got to crystalize all the reasons why you guys are going kill the competitors or the\nreally intelligent thought that got this business started in two sentences. And I need to AHA. You can see whether it's\nhappening when you're saying it. That's why I like two sentences so you get in and out fast. So if I look at you and I'm like,\n\"Uh.\" Then it's ok. You nailed it. If I look at you and I'm like, \"I already knew that.\" Then you didn't nail it. If I looked at you\nand I just don't understand what you're talking about you definitely didn't nail it. So practice that unique insight. In your two\nminute pitch that's all you\u2019re going to get - you're only going to get two sentences to get that out there. So it can't be\ncomplicated. And that's basically the theme of this whole thing right? It cannot be complicated.\nNext - how do you make money? You know your business model. I see so many founders run away from this question\nbecause they think things like if I say advertising people are going to be like \"Oh that's stupid.\" Just say it! Don't run away.\nIf it's advertising - say advertising. Facebook's a massive advertising business. So is Google. If it's direct sales - it's direct\nsales. If it's you know a game and you're selling in app add ups - like that's fine. Just say it. Don't run away from the\nsentence. It only has to be one sentence long. Where founders get tricked on how you will make money is they say, \"Well\n- we're going to run advertising. Maybe some virtual goods. We're going to figure out how to this. And maybe this.

Now you've told me you have no idea how you monetize this. This was a\ncheck mark that I just wanted to write. And then I am going to monetize it - instead I am writing a bug question mark. So do\nthe thing that everyone else your industry does to monetize 95 percent of the time - say it and move on. Like it's totally ok.\nNo one\u2019s going to hold your feet to the fire and say three years later you didn't monetize this way. But it's much better to\nbe clear and concise than it is to start spouting out every single way your company can make money.\nThen next one is team. I think that this answer is actually really clear. I think you're trying to do two things. If your team has\ndone something particularly impressive - you need to call that out. \"We were the founders of PayPal.\" Probably want to\nsay that. \"We were the founders of Amazon.\" Probably want to say that. So if you guys have done something that is made\ninvestors money. You want to say that. If not, then please don't go on about the awards your team has one or the PhDs - I\ndon't care. I don't care. What we want to hear is how many founders. Hopefully between two and four. We want to here is\nhow many them are technical? How many engineers versus business people. Hopefully it's fifty/ fifty of more engineers.\nWe want to hear is that how long have you guys known each other? We don't want to hear that you guys met a founders\ndating an even three days ago. Ideally you've known each other either personally or professional for at least six months.\nWe want hear is that you're all working full time. It's really helpful. We're all committed to this business. And what we\nwanna hear is how you met. That's it. You can get in and out of that two sentences very easy. Your only way to build\ncredentials is if you have accomplished something. And with an investor, typically if you accomplished something that's\nmade someone some money. So don't try to over inflate yourself if you don't have that stat on your resume. Move on. The\nmore you talk about a bad thing - the worse it looks.\nSo the last one is the big ask. When it comes to this, you have to figure out whether this is a conversation involves\nfundraising or not. What I tell people is like this is the time where you kind have to know what you're talking about. This is\na time where you have to know are you raising on convertible note. Are you raising on a safe. You have to know what the\ncap of that safe is. You have to know how much money you're raising. You have to know what the minimum check size is.\nThese are things where if you don't know these things, investors going be like, \"These guys aren't serious. Or they haven\u2019t\ndone their homework.\" So where's the rest of this whole thing you shouldn't use any jargon. This part you shouldn't just be\nlike \"Oh we're just raising some money.\" Now is time to actually use a little bit of that jargon. If you don't know that jargon -\nGoogle search it. Like it's real simple. You'll guys learn it fast. That's it. That's all your pitch. Done. Game over. Now you let\nthem talk.\nWhen to fundraise? This is important. You've got this little growth graph here. Investors like to invest based on traction. It\nis literally always better to raise money when you have more traction than less. Often times though, you will be in a\nsituation where you're just starting or you just launched. What you need to do is you need to think about how you flip the\nequation. Your entire mindset should be: you are the ones asking investors for money and therefore they are strong and\nyou are weak. How do you create a scenario where you are strong and they are weak? That's where you want to be\nfundraising. First, how do you know that you're strong? If investors are asking to give you money, you're strong.

If investors are asking to give you money, you're strong. That\nmight be a good time to start fundraising. If investors aren't asking about giving you money, are you talking to people\nabout your start up? Or are you running super stealth? If you're talking to people about your start up and you're getting the\nword out, either through the press or just through talking to your friends or people you know doing startups, that's a good\nway to start feeding that.\nThe second this is, have you created a plan so that you can launch and grow without needing to raise a bunch of money?\n95 percent of the startups that I meet can get a product to market with a very little bit of money. Never put the investor in\nthe ultimate position of power. \"We can't do anything until you give us money.\" You always want to flip it around. You\nalways want it to be, \"This thing's moving. We all left our jobs. We're all working full time and it's moving. If you want to\njump on, great. If not, there are a lot of angel investors.\" That's the attitude you want to have. That's the confidence you\nwant to have. If you need money early, always plan on needing less money. Always be able to show that you've got a\nfully committed team that's working fast. That's going to be how you gain an advantage when you can't show traction. If\nyou can show an investor that you haven\u2019t launched yet but you've done eight months of work in one month or two\nmonths and you've got a great team that have all quit their jobs and they're totally committed, then you get some\nadvantage back. You don't get all of the advantage unless you have launched and are growing.\nFinally how to set up investor meetings. This is really, really simple but I'm surprised at how many companies don't get\nthis right. The first is you want a warm introduction from another entrepreneur preferably.

If someone who's past on your company as an investor offers you to make introductions\nthat's kryptonite. Don't touch that. So first warm introduction. Very simple. You don't want to cold call these people. You\ndon't want to bum rush these people. The person - the credibility of the person who is introducing you to an investor is big\npart on whether the investor will take that meeting.\nSecond, think in parallel. So many people that I meet will run the fundraising the super slow process. We met with one\nguy this we. We're going to schedule a meeting with another guy next week. Another guy three weeks from now. When\nyou're fundraising you're on. It's a sprint. It's not a marathon. So you want to schedule all of your meetings during the\nsame week. It's extremely hard to do but here's one trick that I love - tell when you're emailing investors you getting those\nwarm intros the investors email you back you say, \"Hey we would love to set up a meeting but we're building like crazy for\nthe next two weeks. So can we set it in that third week?\" Right? So then you've emailed everyone that. Right? So\neveryone schedules that meeting three weeks out. It's better for them because their calendars open. It's better for you\nbecause you've got all you meetings in one week. And also what did you do? You hinted, \"Hey. I am not desperate for the\nmoney. We're building. Like I can meet you in three weeks but we're building. We're busy.\" Like it's signally all of the right\nthings. So, that's the best way to kind of go about how you're gonna do that. The last thing is one team member should be\ninvesting in fundraising full time. It shouldn't be something that takes over the whole company. Because it's very, very\ndistracting.\nSo with that - let's kick it off to the next part of this. Who am I handing it to?\nDalton: Hi. My name is Dalton Caldwell. I'm one of the partners at YC and one of the things that we're going to do today\nreal quick is a mock pitch. And first of all I know this is a bit contrived. This is - in this format of like a college class, we're\ngoing to do our best to have fun and kind of demonstrate what it's like. And I realize there's a million reasons why this -\nwhy you can say, \"Of this isn't realistic of what pitches really like.\" But again there's a lot that we can show you.\nJust in terms of my background - over my career I've raised 85 million over several companies so I've sat in a lot of\ninvestors meetings. So I'm going to be pulling as many things as I can. So again, we're just going to try to show you\nsomething to talk to and use it as a learning session. You already did your intro earlier Qasar right?\nQasar: I've done a couple of startups.\nDalton: Cool. We're going to do two pitches and go through them pretty fast. As Michael said, these tend to go fast. Let's\ngo dive into the first one.\nQasar, I understand you're coming to pitch me today. What can you tell me about what you do?\nQasar: We're building a communication platform that will allow businesses and consumers to collaborate on one single\nplatform rather than in the fractured state that they're in right now.\nDalton: I don't follow.\nQasar: Think about WhatsApp or Snapchat. Those are for consumers. We want to do that for businesses. I have to do this\nwith a straight face. What that means is we want to enable consumers to talk to businesses. That's the goal of our\nbusiness or what our startup is.\nDalton: Who uses this product? What does the product do?\nQasar: It\u2019s for consumers and businesses. A messaging product that allows consumers to send-\nDalton: Why would a consumer want to use your product?\nQasar: Because they want to message a business.\nDalton: What can you tell me about the market and the opportunity? What's the size of this company?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3792, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ca37c14-ebc8-4078-add9-11c3da8b62ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ca37c14-ebc8-4078-add9-11c3da8b62ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8a1e178-de55-4eef-b324-6a544044fca1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "e4e25551d5cbc77fcb4ac07eb4f81f36aff00136dc8ba9628b879ce12c92a787", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6cc869d-778d-4935-bc17-be374b089401", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "173", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "75d2673726165d0ca849bb64bdc810fcaa91d56366e63df1571faac145d66043", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc9f2395-03db-4dbf-874d-e44a4e48125a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef1ce5f6d46a5aff2daf53e51980f3615fe2713916da96268c12db88b9f9b8c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5284c164b3a491bdc7c4555c690283fb4cf97178fc6e1337a60cb23e9168340b", "text": "Qasar: Messaging companies are really big obviously. WhatsApp sold for 19 billion dollars. Snapchat is really growing\nvery quickly as well. We think the opportunity is very big.\nDalton: Can you tell me a little bit about your traction, your numbers. Have you given this to people yet?\nQasar: We don't want to open the kimono and go into all the details here. I had a high level hour live, we definitely have\nthousands of users in the Bay area. Hundreds of businesses.\nDalton: Can you tell me who some of those businesses are?\nQasar: There's ones that you've been to. We don't really want to get too much into the details because we're still early,\nwe're trying to stay stealth.\nDalton: Ok well, can you tell me about what you've learned so far. What insights that you've had from the customers...\nQasar: Yeah the consumers are sending messages to these businesses. And we think that's great. So and these\nbusinesses are responding to the messages and we think that's - I don't think that's obvious that would happen.\nDalton: So can you tell me about what your business model is and how...\nQasar: Yeah so we, we charge businesses like a monthly rate. We haven't precisely figured out what that is. We - right\nnow we're free for the few hundred companies we're in right now. But we\u2019re looking to probably do a monthly...\nDalton: How much do you think a business would be willing to pay?\nQasar: We thing certainly ten to fifteen thousand dollars a month...\nDalton: Ok. So anyway can you tell me a little bit about your team and who you have working on this.\nQasar: Yeah we have five founders. Technically I am the only one who's full time. Right now. We're raising money. So we\ncan get you know the rest of the team on board. Yeah\nDalton: Can any of the founders program or...\nQasar: Yeah. I mean we have - one of them has a Bio PhD but he's really picked up coding. The - I am a python\ndeveloper. I did - I learned python the hard way.\nDalton: Look at the time. Well it's been really great meeting you. Please keep me in the loop. This sounds fantastic.\nQasar: I will send you an update.\nDalton: Just keep me in the loop as this progresses.\nQasar: I'll send you an update. Great. That was awful.\nDalton: Ok. So let's go through.\nSam: That's disturbing.\nDalton: That was obviously not strong. Let's talk about some of the mistakes. First of all, you need to make sure the\nperson you're talking to knows what you do.\nQasar: This seems really simple but it's not.\nDalton: So many times people get flustered. They get nervous and they start talking really fast. There's no way you're ever\ngoing to convince anyone of anything if they don't know even what your app actually is. You have to know your numbers\nobviously. If you're very vague or evasive, don't even have a meeting.

It means you\u2019re not ready yet.\nFor market size, try to give some plausible bottom up analysis and don't just name drop big companies that aren't even\nrelated to what you're doing. People tend to do that a lot. Try to have insights. Try to convince me that there is something\nthat I don't already know about the market that I learned talking to you.

Obviously that went poorly and\nhe just let the conversation flail around until I cut the meeting because I ran out of time as fast as I could.\nThat was not a good pitch. Let's try that again.\nQasar. Ok. Let's do this.\nDalton: Qasar, I understand you have a company. Can you tell me a little bit about what you guys do?\nQasar: Yes, we're a messaging product. That's kind of vague. What we allow you to do is essentially message a location.\nWhen you walk into a Crate and Barrel, you can send the Crate and Barrel manager a message like, \"Hey. There's puke\nin the hallway.\" Or if you're in the airport \"I am trying to find this specific gate 'cause I am not at this airport, \"Where is the\nterminal for Virgin?\" Or if you're at Target, \"What aisle is the shampoo in?\"\nDalton: So is this a mobile app?\nQasar: On the consumer side we have an iOS and Android app but getting consumers to download apps is obviously\nvery difficult.\nDalton: I don't usually download app just to send a message to Crate and Barrel.\nQasar: Most businesses have a call to action which says text the owner directly. We tested a bunch of copy that works the\nbest in small print. In small print we have the messages are anonymous. They also lower the barrier to entry. I think that\nmost counter intuitive then we've learned in the kind of launch that we've had - in three hundred fifty locations in Bay.\nWe've been doing this for about three months. We're about 11 percent weekly growth rate in terms of requiring\nbusinesses but most counterintuitive thing that we learned - Because we weren't actually sure is - Will people send\nmessages while they walk it work...\nDalton: Do people send messages\nQasar: and they do.\nDalton: Like what's the number one type of message that people send?\nQasar: So originally we started the product thinking this is going to be like in location feedback. That was the premise. In\nlocation feedback. What we found is more than half the messages are actually not about feedback at all. They ask things\nlike, \"We were in this location in San Jose - this khaabob stand - Father and Son and we say messages that went through\nthe satellite like are you hiring? And that's like very strange because you would think like why wouldn't you just ask the\nowner? But we realized that we know this is the owner and the person who's walking in doesn't and so they do prefer to\nactually just text the owner because I think that's an easier reading.\nDalton: Ok so it's like a suggestion box. It's like a way to just like message a business\nQasar: Initially that's what we thought what it was. But what we actually discovered was vast majority of - I shouldn't say\nvast majority. Over half the messages are just things like, \"When do you open? When do you close? 'Cause that's not on\nGoogle. Do you - are you catering? Do you have any reservations available tonight?\" etc.\nDalton: Ok look - in terms of your traction is sounds like you said some businesses. Like tell me about what you guys\nhave right now.\nQasar: So we have three hundred and fifty businesses - all from San Jose to San Francisco.

We're all technical but we actually did all the sales because we learned a lot about how these businesses\nwork. We actually come from a retail background. We originally built this product for large enterprise players like\nStarbucks and Walmart but we recognized at closing those contracts and our limited amount of runway wouldn't really be\npossible. So we wanted to get the product in the hands of users so we did S&B's. And that's when discovered, hey this\nlike messaging product...\nDalton: Ok that sounds interesting. It sounds like you have customers. How can this be big though? Like ok - maybe you\ncan get whole thousands of words....\nQasar: So in terms of like numbers - we see one and half messages on average per location per day. That might not\nsound a lot but for a business that's getting thirty messages - you take like a Yelp review or a Google review in a life time\nof business they might get five or seven. So they're getting a huge volume of messages relative to what they tend to\nexperience and they're private so they are not public. So in terms of how do we actually make money, it\u2019s not - you know\nfrankly speaking we don't have a very clear answer there. The two pats are the S&B side or the LC side the large\ncustomer side. Large customers we know from a retail experience just regular feedback tools are are three to four million\nper per year. So like a Sears - where we came from. S&B's we've tested are willing to pay 50 dollars a month. So I, you\nknow certainly I think this is - can be a large business but there's clear ways to make money but...\nDalton: I can see that. Just a couple things. Like, can you tell me about distribution strategy and also just a little bit about\nthe team\nQasar: Yeah, so distribution - so the thing that we learned in selling through these S&B's is really freaking hard. The\nformula LTV minus CPA - Life time value minus Cost Proposition A in S&B is never going to work out. So we have two\nsolutions - one is to go up market like we originally planned to Starbucks or Walmart\u2019s. Or two is actually essentially pair\nwith consumer facing companies Yelp, Google, Facebook...\nDalton: Have you been talking with them. Are they going to actually do it?\nQasar: Yeah - so we've talked to Google and Facebook. We're meeting with the Apple. We're basically want to introduce\nevery time you search for a business there should be a message button. We want to get consumers in the habit of\nknowing they can send essentially a text message to any business. That can help us get broad distribution. Our real\nvision is to become kind of that infrastructure - that messaging infrastructure between consumers and businesses. If that\ndoesn't work - Let's say Google, Facebook and Yelp don't want to give up that valuable property - it's really an add unit.\nWe do just want to sell this an s feedback tool to large players.\nDalton: Alright. Can you tell me a little about the team - we're running low on time.\nQasar: There's three of us. All technical. Mike and I did a company before. Sonny was an ex school engineer. We come\nfrom retail. So our first start up was a failure. So I don't know if that's good or bad. We've worked together - we're all\ntechnical. We all built everything ourselves. And we sold everything ourselves.\nDalton: Ok.\nQasar: So we already had a couple of conversations with your firm. We're raising five hundred thousand on an 8.5 million\nconvertible note. Of that five hundred two hundred -fifty is committed by Mike Maples, Eli Gill and Aden Sinket. And Mike\nwith Floodgate is willing to fill the round. We think you're - you particularly - you and your firm can bring a lot to the team\nwith your retail experience. Is this something that's interesting to you?\nDalton: Yeah - you know I think this is really interesting. I mean I would need to talk to a couple of more folks on my side\nbut I do think that this - this could be pretty big.\nQasar: Yeah since we\u2019ve had a couple of conversations before and we\u2019re certainly willing to meet again. We are closing\na round this Friday and so certainly take time and let you other partners know. I will be available between now and\nFriday. I'll give you another call before Friday before we close the round.

Well it sounds good. I got to go but thanks for that\nQasar: Great. Thanks.\nDalton: So in terms of that one you know - some key points here is try to actually tell a narrative that makes sense to\npeople. You noticed there was narratives there talking about people - how they really use it. We were able to like tie it\ndown to the real world. Which is good. He was able to demonstrate insights and actually tell me something I didn't\nalready know about the market. Like there were some tid bits. It was more of a collaborative meeting where it felt more\nlike a conversation than just like I was interviewing about something in my opinion. He actually asked for money. You\nsaw I could have easily been just like, \"Ok. Got to go.\" But he did talk about fundraising as Michael mentioned. And he\nwas able to provide all he context and all the the questions to actually have a serious conversation with him. If he was KG\nabout it or shy about and clear on the numbers there's a very good chance I probably would have just ended the\nconversation due to time pressure.\nQasar: Yeah. It's interesting we sit on this side a lot. You really - you can tell when people are very passionate and know\ntheir business very, very well. And that's what you have to become.\nOk so closing thoughts here before we - what you want to do after the meeting. Before we get into Q&A. We're running a\nlittle short on time.\nAfter the meeting the first just like Tyler said in the sales things follow up. This is important. Anything other than a check or\nwired funds is a no. So they we got to keep talking to partners - I assume that's a no. And so you do want to put some\npressure. The way you can do that is get deal heat. A deal heat is just a term that means there's a demand to be in your\nround. This is the easiest way and important way to drive a price, etc. Do diligence on investors, So let's say you have that\nfive hundred thousand to raise for your seed round on the 8.5 million like we used as an example, Do diligence on the\ninvestors - If you do find - I do the diligence on Dalton and I found that hey he's actually not great investor, I can get Millan\nor Mike Maples or whoever to actually fill the rest of the round. It's uprising to us how money entrepreneurs don't do this.\nYou would - it\u2019s like you would actually spend a lot of time hiring somebody - you\u2019re selling a part of your company to\nsomebody you should know who you're selling it to to make sure they're the type of people you think they are. And then\nlast - know when to stop. So some founders get so good a fundraising they just want to it all the time because it\u2019s much\neasier to do than actually building the company.\nDalton: Fundraising does not equal success. Nobody realizes that. We'll say this now but I am sure that everyone will still\nequate fundraising with success and read about someone\u2019s fundraising and assume that means they're successful.\nQasar: My intuition about why this is true is because a lot of smart people applied to good schools and to good jobs and\nthey think fundraising is just another application that they can check off. Building a company is much more ambiguous.\nSam: Can you guys just stick around for a few minutes after to answer questions?\nThank you guys very much that was great!", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3279, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16f39fab-a956-459e-8ce4-0ec4dd9a1f81": {"__data__": {"id_": "16f39fab-a956-459e-8ce4-0ec4dd9a1f81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e7de263-415f-4765-99ee-4eea2689fd6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "51ca19577a607c6d0fc00e78f852ce494be5ec366b47130f681c2aaeab40df0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa9f675e-71a1-4815-8d98-48c72e2bc43b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "cff947a1d881c5eefa4cf50a9ad581e25d2610c289599a5a22535255cd4310c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7766aa9f-fd12-4e05-a1e0-b7ff2f5ff836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f2577232e36c0831cd36cb4d04f5df40747fff4cb174702c11475ce024e5bfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "67ba058ddf2e590249eb48a7e9a1aa1d800910b5c61f22bf3220c82647125504", "text": "Good afternoon. Welcome to the last class of How to Start a Start Up. This is a little bit different than other classes, which\nhave been about things that you should think about at the beginning of a startup. Today we're going to talk about things\nthat you don't have to think about for a while. Since I'm going to not going to get to talk to most of you again before you get\nto post-product market fit stage, I want to give you the list of things that you need to think about as your startup scales. The\nlist of the things that founders usually fail to make the transition on.\nThese are the topics we're going to talk about. Again, these are not writing code or talking to users, which means with a\nfew exceptions that I'll try to note, you can ignore them until after you have product market fit. For most companies, these\nthings become important between months 12 and 24. Write these down somewhere and look back them when you get\nthere.\nThe first area we're going to talk about is management. In the beginning of a company, there is no management. This\nactually works really well. Before 20 and 25 employees, most companies are structured with everyone reporting to\nfounder. It's totally flat. That's really good. That's what you want because at that stage, it's the optimal structure for\nproductivity.\nWhat tricks people is when lack of structure fails, it fails all at once. What works totally fine at 20 employees is disastrous\nat 30. You want to be aware that this transition will happen. You don't actually need to make the structure complicated. In\nfact, you shouldn't. All you need is for every employee to know who their manager is and for everyone to have exactly one\nmanager. Every manager should know their direct reports.\nYou ideally want to cluster people in teams that make sense but the most important thing is that there is a clear reporting\nstructure and that everyone knows what it is. Clarity and simplicity are the most important things here. Failing to do this\ncorrectly is really bad. Because it works in the early days to have no structure at all, it feels cool to have no structure.\nMany companies are like, \"We're going to try this crazy new management theory and have no structure.\" You want to\ninnovate on your product and your business model.\nManagement structure is not where I would recommend trying to innovate. Don't make the mistake of having nothing, but\ndon't make the other mistake of having something super complicated. A lot of people fall into this trap. They think people\nfeel cool if they're someone\u2019s manager and if they're just an employee, they don't feel cool. So people come up with\nconvoluted circular matrices management structures where you report to this person for this thing, and this person for that\nthing, and this person for that thing, while this person reports to you for this thing. That's a mistake.\nThis is the first instance of an important shift in the founder\u2019s job. Before product market fit, your number job is to build a\ngreat product. As the company grows past 25 employees, your main job shifts from building a great product to building a\ngreat company and it stays there for the rest of your time. This is probably the biggest shift in being a founder.\nThere are four failure cases we see all the time as founders become managers. So I am going to talk about the four most\ncommon ones. The first one is: \"being afraid to hire senior people.\" In the early days of a startup, hiring senior people is\nusually mistake. You just want people that get stuff done, and the willingness to work hard and aptitude matters more\nthan experience. As the company starts to scale, and at about this time when you have to put in place the basic\nmanagement structure - it is actually valuable to have senior people on the team. Executives that have built companies\nbefore. Almost all founders after the first time they hire a really great executive, and that executive takes over big pieces of\nthe business and just makes them happen - the founder says, \"Wow! I wish I had done that earlier!\" But everybody makes\nthis mistake and waits to long to do this. So don't be afraid to hire senior executives.\nThe second mistake is \"Hero Mode\". I will use the example of saying someone that runs the customer service team.\nLecture 20: Closing Thoughts and Later-Stage Advice\nSam Altman", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4332, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7766aa9f-fd12-4e05-a1e0-b7ff2f5ff836": {"__data__": {"id_": "7766aa9f-fd12-4e05-a1e0-b7ff2f5ff836", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3589a756-34aa-4146-b39d-427a44cdf78d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "b739dcb53e730caebaf8eecdab0ff91fc1cbcc767a1dd144b3c88ed5ce72ecc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16f39fab-a956-459e-8ce4-0ec4dd9a1f81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "178", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "67ba058ddf2e590249eb48a7e9a1aa1d800910b5c61f22bf3220c82647125504", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90bc0c2e-894d-472a-8632-5708ff5964be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b22a9f8f16f105e768abf4bf4452837289e65aea7c6b8677dcd46b5a842416ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7f2577232e36c0831cd36cb4d04f5df40747fff4cb174702c11475ce024e5bfe", "text": "Someone who runs the customer service team -- they want to lead by example. This starts from a good place. It's the\nextreme of leading by example.\nIt's saying, \u201cYou know what? I want my team to work really hard rather than tell them to work hard I'm going to set an\nexample. I'm going to work 18 hours a day. I'm going to show people how to get a lot of tickets done.\" But then company\nstarts growing. They have the normal discomfort of assigning a lot of work to other people. So the company starts growing\nand the ticket volume keeps going up. Now they're have to do like 19 hours a day, and then 20 hours a day. It\u2019s just\nobviously not working. But they won't stop and hire people because they're like, \"If I stop even for one day we're going to\nget behind on tickets.\" The only way to get out of hero mode in this case is to say, \"You know what? We're going to get\nbehind on tickets for two or three weeks 'cause I am going to go off and I am going to hire three more support team\nmembers. I've calculated based off our growth rate that this is going to last this long. Next time I'm not going to make the\nsame mistake. I'll get ahead of it and hire again.\"\nBut you actually have to make a trade off. You actually have to say, \"You know what? I need to hire more people and\nwe're going get behind on other stuff.\" That is the right answer. The wrong answer is to stay in hero mode until you burn\nout. Which is what most people do.\nThird mistake: \"Bad Delegation\". Most founders have not managed people before and certainly have not managed\nmanagers. The bad way you delegate is you say, \"Hey, employee, we need to do this big thing. You go off and research\nit. Come back to me with all the data and the tradeoffs. I'll make a decision and tell it to you and then you go off and\nimplement.\" That's how most founders delegate. That does not make people feel good and it certainly doesn't scale.\nA subtle difference but really important is to say, \u201cHey - you're really smart. That's why I hired you. You go off. Here the\nthings to think about. Here's what I think. But you make this decision. I totally trust you. And let me know what you decide.\"\nThat's how delegation actually works. Steve Jobs was able to get away with the former, and make every decision himself\nand people just put up with it. Every founder thinks they're the next Steve Jobs. A lot of people try this. For 99.9 percent of\npeople, this second method here works a lot better.\nThen the fourth area -- it's just a personal organization one. When you are working on product, you don't actually need to\nbe that organized in terms of how you run the company and how you talk to people about what they're working on. But if\nyou fail to get your own personal organization system right - where you can keep track in some way of what you need to\nand what everybody else is doing and what you need to follow up with them on - that will come back to bite you.\nDeveloping this early as the company begins to scale is really important.\nTwo other things that we hear again and again from our founders they wish that they had done early: simply writing down\nhow you do things and why you things. These two things - the how and the why - are really important. In the early days,\nyou just tell everyone. \"Employee, when you're sitting around having lunch or dinner, you know this is how we think about\nbuilding product. This is how we push to production. You know, this is how we handle customer supper.\"\nWhatever. As you get bigger you can't keep doing that. If you don't do it, someone else is just going to say it. But if you\nwrite it down and put it up on a Wiki or whatever that every employee reads, you as the founder get to basically write the\nlaw. And if you write this down it will become law in the company. And if you make everyone read this - as the company\nhires a hundred and then a thousand employees - people will read this and say, \"Alright. That's how we do things.\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3940, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90bc0c2e-894d-472a-8632-5708ff5964be": {"__data__": {"id_": "90bc0c2e-894d-472a-8632-5708ff5964be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3589a756-34aa-4146-b39d-427a44cdf78d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "b739dcb53e730caebaf8eecdab0ff91fc1cbcc767a1dd144b3c88ed5ce72ecc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7766aa9f-fd12-4e05-a1e0-b7ff2f5ff836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "7f2577232e36c0831cd36cb4d04f5df40747fff4cb174702c11475ce024e5bfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "832b75b3-bba9-4092-aad4-18cb22d558b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e39bd34d5aaf8012551d65cdc8ce69295c7521c598c9762d1f6e535d9c5d8db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b22a9f8f16f105e768abf4bf4452837289e65aea7c6b8677dcd46b5a842416ee", "text": "These two things - the how and the why - are really important.

So writing down how you do things and the why -- the why is the cultural\nvalues. Brian Chest talked about this really well. Every founder I know wishes they written down both of these - the how\nand the why- earlier to just establish it as the company grows. And then this becomes what happens. It's one of the\nhighest leverage things you can do that people don't.\nNext area - \"HR\". HR is another thing that most people correctly ignore in the first phase of start up because, again, it's not\nwriting code. It's not talking to users. But it\u2019s a huge mistake they continue to ignore it. The reason I think most founders\nignore it is they have in their mind this idea of like TV sitcom HR, you know. Awfulness.

What good HR means is a few\nthings. A clear structure. Which we already talked about you know a path for people about how they can evolve their\ncareers. Most important, one of the most important things is \"Performance Feedback.\" Again, this happens organically\nearly on. People know how they're doing. As the company gets to 25, 30, 45 people - that gets lost and it doesn't have to\nbe complex. It can be super simple. But there should be a way that it happens and it should be frequent. People need\nhear pretty quickly how they're doing. It should tell if they are doing badly to where you get them out of the company. Or if\nthey're doing well it should. There should be a clear path to how this ties to compensation. That\u2019s the next thing.\nIn the early days of a startup, people compensation is whatever they negotiate with the founder and it's all over the place.\nAs you grow - it feels hopelessly corporate but it really is worth putting in place these \"Compensation Bands\". So a mid-\nlevel engineer is in this range. A senior engineer is this range. Here's how you move from this to this. It keeps things\nreally fair. Someday everyone will find out everyone else's comp. If it's all over the place, it will be complete meltdown\ndisaster. If you put these bands in place early you will at least be fail. It will also save you a lot of crazy negotiation.\nOne thing that I think is really important when it comes to HR is equity. Most people get this right now for the early\nemployees. They give a lot of equity. But you should continue to give a lot of equity all the way through. And this is one\nplace that you investors will always give you bad advice. I think - not YC. But all other investors give bad advice here.\nMost do. You should be giving out a lot of equity to your employees. Now this dilutes everyone.\nRight? This dilutes you as the founder and the investors equally. For some reason founder usually understand this as\ngood. Investors are very short-sighted and don\u2019t want to dilute themselves so they'll like fight you over every equity grant.\nBut, we've seen a lot of data at YC now and the most successful companies - and the ones where the investors do the\nbest - end up given a lot of stock out to employees. Year after year... After year.\nSo I tell founders, \"You should think about for the next ten years you're going to be given out 3- 5 percent of the company\nevery year 'cause you just get bigger and bigger. So the individual grants gets smaller but in actuality it's a lot of stock.\nThis is really important to do if you value your people you should be doing this. Specifically, you need to do this with\nrefresher grants. And you should get a plan in place for this early. You never want an employee in a place where they\nvested 3 out of their four years in stock and they start thinking about leaving. So you should ALWAYS stay in front of\npeoples vesting schedules. And you know how they plan early where you have refresher grants in place.\nThere are a lot of new structures that people have been using here. I personally like six year big grants - but six years of\nvesting. 'Cause I think these companies take a while to build. There's pyramid vesting where you back weight someone\u2019s\ngrant. In year four they get a lot more of the vesting than year one. There's a concept - different names for it, but\nsomething like continuous forward vesting where people's grants are automatically re-upped. Every year. At the same\nnumber of share. Whatever you decide, get an option management system in place at about this point. The normal way\npeople do this is just someone keeps an Excel spreadsheet.

Common examples\nare that you have to start \"Sexual Harassment Training and Diversity Training\". There's a bunch of others as well. But just\nput a little pen in your mind that when you cross 50 employees there's a new set of HR rules that you have to comply with.\n\"Monitoring your team for burnout.\" Again, it's up to product market fit. It's just a sprint. Now it becomes marathon. At this\npoint you actually don't want people to work a 100 hours a week forever. You want them to go on vacation. You want\nthem to have new challenges and do new things. And if you let the whole company get burned out all at once - that is\noften a company ending thing.\nThis is also a good time to put in place a \"hiring process\". Another thing that most founders regret is they don't hire - as\nsoon as everything is working, you should hire a \"full time recruiter\".

Because like half the time you do that. Someone in\nthe company will know something good or bad about that employee. The companies that I know that have instituted this\nhave been really happy. Also a good time to have a program in place to ramp up employees. So when someone starts,\nyou know what their first week looks like. How did they get spun up? How do they learn everything they need to learn?\nAre they going to have a buddy that's going to think through them? That's going help them think through everything about\nthe company.\nHere\u2019s one that you do need to think about before the 12 to 24 month mark. Which is \"Diversity on the team.\" The most\ncommon place this comes up honestly is people that hire you know all guys on their engineering team for the first 15 or\n20 people. And at that point you get a culture in place that sort of takes on a life of its own. Most founders that I've spoken\nto that have made this mistake regret it. They wish they had hired some diversity of perspective on the team earlier on.\nEngineering teams are not the only place where it comes up. But that's where you see it the most often, and if you get this\nright early, you\u2019ll be able to grow the team much more quickly over the long term.\nThe other thing to think about is what happens to your early employees. So a common situation that happens is the\ncompany past the early employees. You know the company - you hire a engineer who's a really great engineer but then\nas the engineering team grows, you need a VP of engineering. The early engineer wants to be the VP of engineering.\nYou can't do that, but you don't want the early employee to leave. They are an important part of the culture. They know a\nlot. People love them. So I think you want you be very proactive about this. You want to think about, \"What's the path for\nmy first 10 or 15 employees going to be as the company grows?\" And then just talk to them about it. Very directly. Be up\nfront, you know. Sit them down and say, \"I want to see where you want to see your career go inside of this company.\"\nAlright, so - \"Company Productivity\". This is something that you don't need to think in the early days because small teams\nare just naturally productive most of the time. But as you grow, it - the productivity - goes down with the square of the\nnumber of employees if you don't make an effort. Because it's sort of one these connections between nodes. Every pair of\npeople add communication overhead. If you don't start thinking about the systems that you're going to put in place when\nthe company is 25-50 people to stay productive as you grow - things will grind into a halt faster than you can imagine.\nThe second word that matters most to keep the company productive as it grows is \"Alignment\". The reason companies\nbecome unproductive is people are either not on the same page and you know don't know what the same priorities are.\nOr they actively working against each other. Which is obviously worse. But if you can keep the entire aligned in the same\ndirection, you have won well over half of the battle. The way to start with this is just a very clear road map and goals.\nEveryone in the company should know what the road map for the next three or six months or a year - depending on\nwhere the company is in its life cycle.\nYou know a classic test that I love to give - is if I walk into a company getting - beginning to struggle with these scaling\nissues - I'll ask the founders, \"Like, if I walked around and pulled 10 random employees and asked them what the top\nthree goals for the company are right now - would they all say the same thing?\" And 100 percent of the time the founder\nsays, \u201cYes. Of course they would.\"\nThen I'll go do it and 100 percent of the time, no two employees even say the same three top three goals in order. The\nfounders can never believe it. Because they're like, \"Well I announced it in all hands like three months what are goals\nwere going to be. And how can they not remember?\"", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4158, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99afaf3f-bde1-4d8a-b3a2-e8c5ca5ab409": {"__data__": {"id_": "99afaf3f-bde1-4d8a-b3a2-e8c5ca5ab409", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c05aecb-63e8-4a5c-b2c5-a3de8ff8e3a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "2f8f7522b62b8c53c28cb83d94fd8c3b7dd2271a068aa7777b95d8b39450e992", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a88e05e-96f2-4b92-bc1f-3d396173b066", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "98522ab9d9db43b40edf8a12af27be2b2f0094f07b41d8ddf49502d9a9411563", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e68bd4d4-6e38-4c85-a7e6-7374d20ca12f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "518d6858d8def23f9451fbd4749a3599f4a478e7b82a68c37ec0825a8d61fd9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2b0a10b6bb34cf48e2456cafd01a495efda2806605ee7a9464eecdece87a1f61", "text": "Everyone in the company should know what the road map for the next three or six months or a year - depending on\nwhere the company is in its life cycle.\nYou know a classic test that I love to give - is if I walk into a company getting - beginning to struggle with these scaling\nissues - I'll ask the founders, \"Like, if I walked around and pulled 10 random employees and asked them what the top\nthree goals for the company are right now - would they all say the same thing?\" And 100 percent of the time the founder\nsays, \u201cYes.

But if\npeople don't know what the road map of the goals are, it won't happen.\nWe already talked about figuring out your values early but I want to reiterate that.

If everyone knows what the framework to decide it - they'll make hopefully the same decisions if\nthey're smart people.\nYou want to continue to be run by great products and not process for its own sake.

One easy way to do this that a lot of companies try is they just say, \"We're gonna ship\nsomething every day.\"\nAnd if you do that - you know there's at least a continue focus on delivery. And then \"transparency and rhythm\" in how you\ncommunicate are really important. Most founders wait way too long on these but having a management meeting every\nweek of just the people that report directly to the founder and the CEO - critical. All hands meeting - not quite sure how\noften is optimal for those. At least once a month. Where you go through the results and the road map of the entire\ncompany. Really important. Then doing a plan every quarter of what we're going to get done over the next three months\nand how that fits into our goals for the year - also becomes really important.\nI put \"Offsite\" up there, because people don't do those nearly enough. A surprising number of the successful companies\nwe've been involved with do a lot of off-sites. Where they take their best people for a weekend to a cabin in the woods or\nsomewhere and just talk about what we want to be when we grow up. What are most important things to be doing? What\nare we not doing that we should be doing? But get people out of the office and out of the day today. Everyone I know that\ndoes thinks they're well worth the time.\nSo the goal in all of this productivity planning is that you're trying to build a company that creates a lot of value over a long\nperiod of time. And the long period of time is what's important here. You can avoid all of this and with the authority of the\nfounder - make sure the company ships a great next version. But that won't work for version 10. It won't work for version\n11. The single hardest thing in business is building a company that does repeatable innovation and just has this ongoing\nculture of excellence as it grows. If you look at the examples of this - most companies fail here. Most companies do one\ngreat thing where the founder just pushes to get it done and then don't innovate that well on follow on products. It really\ntakes founders that think about how I am going to do this second thing - this really hard thing to get something like an\napple that can turn out great products for30 or 40 years. Or longer.\nAlright - these are super tactical \"Mechanics\". This is definitely just to put on a list and remember these things for later.\nAlright - in the early days. People basically ignore all accounting and maybe if they're lucky have a shoebox full of\nreceipts. They certainly don't have anything that looks like a financial report. This is is a good time to get it in place. You\nknow when things are working say month 18 or whatever - you can do this with an outsource person. Just say, \"You know\nwhat? We like to get our books in order. We want to start getting audits every year. We want to start a relationship with an\naccounting firm.\" Easy to do. Definitely worth it.\nThis is also a good time to collect your legal documents because it's easy to fix things now. If you actually assign\nsomeone to go through and collect every agreement that the company has ever signed, then when your landlord tries to\nscrew you out of your lease and no one can find the lease... Which happens like half the time somehow. Someone will be\nable to find it. Also, you're almost certainly missing something. Some employees didn't sign their PIAA or whatever and\nyou'll find it now - it\u2019s easy to fix now. It's gets really hard to fix like in the middle of your next round of financing. So again\nthis is time to bring like a little of the order to chaos.\n\"FF Stock\" is a special class of stock for founders that founders can sell in a later round without messing up the common\nstock valuation. It used to be that most people set this up right when they started the company. Founders fund sort of\npopularizes which is why it's called FF stock. But it became a really bad signal.

But it's a good thing to remember\nby around the time you get to the B round.\n\"IP, Trademarks and Patents\". Actually just IP and trademarks. So, you have twelve months after you announce\nsomething if you want to patent it. And if you miss that window, it's very hard to do. So eleven months after launch or first\npublically talk about what you're doing - is a good time to file provisional patents. We recommend people just file\nprovisional patents. All that does is hold your place in line at the patent office, and it gives you another year to decide if\nyou want to patent something or not. It only costs about 1000 dollars. It takes way less effort than a full patent. And most of\nthe time you'll know whether or not you'll need a fully patent a year later.

Again, if you don't do this at this stage -\nmost people end up regretting it. And while you're at it - a good time grab all the domains.\nFP&A -- good time, also to think about someone to start doing FP&A. Most companies don't end realizing where they\nknobs on their financial model are until far too late. It turns out that if you have someone build a really great model of the\nbusiness - and by really great, apparently Roelf Botha - who was the PayPal CFO and built their FP&A model - the top,\nlike the top sheet of his spreadsheet was 15 hundred lines just a level of the detail people build these to. But you can\nreally optimize the business and understand it at a level that most people totally miss. Most people don't hire someone\nlike this until their many hundreds of employees. It's worth hiring earlier.\nAnother thing that I think is worth hiring earlier that almost no one does is a full time fundraiser. Let's say you hire\nsomeone really, really great and their full time job is to raise money for the company. You hire them after your B round.\nAnd you say, \"You know what? By the time we raise our C round, we want the valuation be double what it would have\nbeen otherwise.\" You almost certainly get better results than if you hire an investment banker or someone else if it\u2019s just\nsomeone internal with the company. And you end up paying way less money and take literally half the dilution. This is\none these slightly non-obvious optimization that people just fail to make.\n\"Tax structuring\". This is another thing. Once things are working it would be worth you spending a little bit of time thinking\nabout how you set up the tax structure for the company. I confess I don't know a lot about the details here 'cause I just find\nit personally really boring. But like if you assign the IP to some corporation in Ireland that licensing it back to the US\nCorporation. You end up paying no tax. No corporate tax. But I know that you can only do that relatively early on. And this\nends up being a huge issue for companies that don't do it that compete with companies that do it you know once they're\nbig public companies. So that's worth doing.\nA lot of people through the class have talked about \"Your own Psychology\" as a founder. Here's what they haven't said. It\ngets worse. Not better. As the company grows you continue to osculate. The highs are better but the lows keep getting\nworse. And you really want to think about this early on and just be aware that this is going to happen. And try to, try to\nmanage your own psychology through the expanding swing that it's going through.\nAnother thing that happens as you begin to be successful as you go from being someone that most people rooted for -\nkind of the underdog. To someone that a lot of people hating on. You see this first in internet commenters who will be like,\n\"I can't believe this shitty company raised money. It fucking sucks. It's like awful. And it only bothers you a little bit. But then\njournalists that you kind of care about it start writing this and it just goes on and on. This also will go on and on as you get\nmore and more successful. You just have to make peace with this early. But if you don't it will bother you all the way\nthrough.\nThis is also a good time to start thing about how long of a journey this is going to be. Very few founders think long term.\nMost founders think kind of a year in advance and they think, \"You know what? In three years I am going to sell my\ncompany and either I am going to become a VC or sit on the beach or something.\" Because so few people make an\nactual long term commitment to what they're building - the ones that do have a huge advantage. They're in a a very rare\nflight class. So this is a good time to sit around with your co-founders and decide, \"You know what - we're going to work\non this for a very long time and we're gonna build a strategy that assumes that we're going to be doing this for the next ten\nyears.\" Just thinking that way alone, it's probably a very high leverage thing you can do for success.\nTake vacation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4163, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10dcdcc0-58e8-4336-9218-170f1a9b8351": {"__data__": {"id_": "10dcdcc0-58e8-4336-9218-170f1a9b8351", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8eb3820f-54b4-4fa9-99df-c9293f0244b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "d7e53ce8034ade8a82da35954f1dd1561821f2329d78a139122f7684d3c453a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "177047de-f61b-4209-88aa-00be4c657b9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "183", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "de345e86a74af8b3e411af72566bc86d38b3c627281583bea0db47fb5a601458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d62cdec2-e764-437d-971b-00b6df991f22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8668979e21eea16f050a937cd627e8664557b3165dc473d69692da25aacec24", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e1326b45d1c1ef29ac3826f929b9291eb9efebd2ad8cd5941446426b874ab972", "text": "This is also a good time to start thing about how long of a journey this is going to be.

Another common thing that we see is founders will run their business for three or four years without ever\ntaking more of a day of vacation. And that works for a year or two years or something like that. It really leads to a nasty\nburn out.\nLosing focus is another way that founders get off track. This is a symptom of burnout. When you get really burned out on\nrunning business you want to do easier things or sort of more gratifying things. You want to go to conferences and have\npeople tell you how great you are.

They advise companies. They go to conferences.\nWhatever. Focus is what made you successful in the first place. There are a lot of reasons people lose focus. But fight\nagainst that really, really hard.\nThis is a special case of focus. As you start to do well - you will start to get a bunch of potential acquires sniffing around.\nAnd it's very gratifying. You're like, \"Wow! I can be so rich.\" And I'll be so cool. And MNA negotiations feel really fun. This\nis one of the biggest killers of companies. Is that they entertain acquisition conversations. You distract yourself. You get\ndemoralized if it doesn't happen. If an offer does come in - it's really low. You've already mentally thought that you're done\nand so you take the offer. As a general rule don't start any acquisition conversation unless you're willing to sell for a pretty\nlow number. Don't ever just check it hoping that you're going to have the one miracle high offer. If that's going to happen\nyou\u2019ll know because they'll just make you a big offer before you can meet them. But this is big company killer.\nAnd then - just a reminder to everybody - that things that kills startups at some level is the founders giving up. So\nsometimes you should quit but if you mismanage your own psychology and you quit when you shouldn\u2019t, that is what kills\ncompanies. That is the final cause of death for most of these startups. And so if you can manage your own Psychology in\na way that you don't quit - don't get to a place where you need to quit or give up on the startup. You'll be in a far far better\nplace.\nSo \"Marketing & PR\" is something that we tell companies to ignore for a long time. Everyone thinks in the early days that\nthe press is going to be what saves them. We tell them all the time it doesn't work that way. It\u2019s definitely true. Press is not\nwhat's going to save your start up. But as you start to be successful - this is something that the founders themselves need\nto spend time on. So once your product is working - switch from not caring about this to caring about it a little bit. The two\nmost important things for the founder to do - the founders to do - figure out the key messaging yourselves. Never\noutsource to your head of marketing or PR firm. You founders have to figure out what the message of the company is\ngoing to bet. And once you've set that it kind of sticks. Very hard to change this once the press decides how they\u2019re going\nto talk about you.\nThe other thing is getting to know key journalists yourself. PR firms will always try to prevent you from doing this because\nthey need to have a reason to to exist... And so they're like, \"We're going to handle the relationship with the journalist.\nWe'll just bring you in for interviews.\" No journalist wants to talk to a PR flag ever. They're so much happier to hear from to\njust hear from the founder. The biggest PR hack you can do is to not hire a PR firm. Just pick three or four journalists that\nyou develop really close relationships with that like you. That understand you - which you get. Then you contact them\nyourself; they will cover every story you ever give them. And they'll actually pay attention and get to know you and care\nabout the company. This is so much better than the normal strategy of having a PR firm blast 200 contacts that never read\ntheir emails with every piece of news. This is something that I think is important to start doing.\nThis is also the time in a company when business development starts to matter. And so in the early days you can\nbasically ignore anything that would be like doing deals. Except maybe fundraising and sales. This is a time when they're\nimportant. And everything or many things that you do like even fundraising. It falls under the category of doing deals.\nSo there are - here\u2019s my one minute crash course on this. There are five points that are important to understand here.\nWe've talked about this a lot. Nothing will matter if you don't \"Build a great product\".

That you're using them to get distribution for your product or to raise money or whatever. So figuring\nout some way to actually care about this person and care about what you're doing with them. And not view them - you\nbrave to in your own mind not just view them as this one off transaction.

Most founders learn this the first time in fundraising. But it\nactually matters for everything. The way you get deals done and the ways you get good terms is to have a competitive\nsituation.

So I won't hit on that again too much other than to say you go beyond\nyour comfort point here most of the time as a founder.\nAnd then the fifth point is that \"You have to ask for what you want\". This is another thing - I still have trouble with this and\ncertainly most of the founders we do have. If you want something in a deal - just ask for it. Most of the time, you won't get\nlaughed out of the room and might get it. But you have to be - at some point, you actually have to say, \"You know this is\nwhat I'd like to do.\" Even if it feels aggressive or an over-reach or whatever.\nSo I am going to close this part of the talk with an image. One of the Airbnb founders drew this on like a business card or\nsomething for another founder that starting a company and then I saw it once and took a picture of it. 'Cause I thought it\nwas such a good summary. And what he had tried to draw here was the YCombinator process as he remembers it. I love\nit 'cause it\u2019s like so simple and it looks so doable when it\u2019s written on a business card. But you're trying to find product\nmarket fit. You're trying to build a product and you're trying to close the gap between those two gears. The only way to do\nthat is to go off and meet the people. You can't do this without getting really, really close to your users. And then he drew\nthis graph that sort of on a white board that at YC and gotten kind of sort one of the YC rites of passage. But that's the\ngraph of how adoption goes for a new company.\nSo you launch on the press. You get a huge spike. It falls off to nothing. At some point at least one point things look like\nthey're going to completely die and kind of dip below the X access. They recover a little bit, you have this long, long troth\nof sorrow before things work. In Arabian B's case, it was a thousand days before the graph started taking upward. You\nhave these wiggles of false hope. And then finally, finally, finally, finally things start to grow. Three years later. So starting\na startup ends being this very long process. It is - it can be very rewarding. It's definitely long but it is doable. That's what I\nlove about that drawing.\nSo with that. I have about ten minutes left. I can questions on this or anything else in the course that we've covered. If\nanyone has some.\nYes.\nAudience member #1: You hold that diversity is important, but an earlier speaker said that diversity wasn't important and\nthat you should just hire people that are very much like you and trust you...\nSam: So the question is how you square the device of diversity being important with earlier speakers saying that you\nwant people that are very similar.\nThe difference is that what you want is diversity of backgrounds. But you don't want diversity of vision. Like where\ncompanies get in trouble is when they have people that think very differently about what the company should be doing or\ndon't work well together. You don't want that. You do want hire people that you know and that you trust and that you can\nwork with, but if everyone on the team comes from exactly the same background you do end up developing somewhat of\na monoculture. Which often causes problems down the road. Not always. Some companies have been successful with\nthat.\nSo what we tell people is hire people that you know and that you've worked with before. But try to hire people that\ncomplementary and aligned towards the same goal. Not people that are exactly the same. 'Cause you just get a better\nskill set.\nAudience member #2: So what are some examples of ways to make up productivity on a personal level? How do you do\nthat on a personal level and also on an advance level?\nSam: How to keep track productivity systems. So, the one I use which I actually thinks works really well is I keep one\npiece of paper with my goals for sort of three to twelve month time frame. And I look at that every day. And then separately\nI keep one page for every day of my short term goals for that day. And so if I need to do something in like a week I just flip\nforward seven pages and I write down.

Any advice for how to fail\ngracefully?\nSam: Yeah. Yeah. Great question. We should have covered that.\nHow to fail gracefully. So, most startups fail and Silicon Valley almost goes too far on how it loves failure. Failure still\nsucks. You should still try not to fail. And this whole like thing of like \"Ahh failure is great!\" I don't agree with, but it will\nhappen to most people most of the time and it's a very forgiving environment. As long as you are up front about it and\nethical and don't let anyone get into bad situation. So if you're failing, first of all you should tell your investors, and second\nof all, you should not totally run out of money. What you don't want is blow up which a bunch of depths that the company\nowe and everyone showing up to work one day and the door being locked.\nYou'll know when you're failing and you'll know the company - things just aren't going to work. And you should just tell\nyou investors, \"Like hey. Sorry. This isn't going to work.\" No one will be surprised. Like I expect to lose my - or I'm willing\nto lose my money on every investment I ever I make. I know that happens most of the time and the winners pay for it you\nknow still with a factor of a hundred. And so it's ok, No one - people will be very understanding and supportive. But you\nwant to tell people early. You don't want to surprise them. And you want - you don't want to like let your employees get\nshocked when they know they don't have job. You want shut the company down in a graceful way. Help them find jobs.\nMake sure you give the two or four weeks of severance payment so they're not suffering a cash flow problem. All that stuff\nis pretty important.\nAudience member #4: How many immigrant founders have you seen in YCombinator?\nSam: How many immigrant founders have we seen in YCombinator? In the last batch - I think it probably went up for this\nnext batch. In our last batch 41 percent of the founders we founded we're born outside the US. From thirty different\ncountries. So it's a pretty big percentage.\nAudience member #4: I was just thinking - what do you think are the good places to start start ups?\nSam: Apart from the Valley where do I think are other good places to start a startup. Well I still think the Valley is the best\nby a very significant margin. But I think it's finally maybe beginning to weaken a little bit because the costs have just\ngotten out of control. To be clear - if I was going to start a company I still wouldn't think about it. I still will pick Silicon\nValley. And think if you look at the data of companies of over the last few years that is to wins by a lot. But Seattle, LA -\nLots of places outside the US - I think all of these makes sense.\nAudience member #4: Like places outside the US?\nSam: I hesitate to make recommendations because I haven't spent enough time in the cities to really have an intuitive\nfeel. But like - you know as well as I do the common ones people talk about start up hubs. I just can't make a personal\nrecommendation there.\nAudience member #5: So when should the founders start to thinking about hire a professional CEO - a senior guy?\nSam: When should the founders think about hiring a professional CEO?

Sometimes they even hire\nprofessional CEO and realize that is not going to like build a great company and so Larry Page came to be CEO again.

But generally that the transition that I talked about today if you go from build ing a great\nproduct to building a great company being a founder for nine of the ten years is going to be about building that great\ncompany and if you're not excited about doing that - I think you should think hard about it.\nAudience member #6: What are some of the most common and alarming warning signs you should be looking for when", "start_char_idx": 3175, "end_char_idx": 4350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "072744ce-01eb-4e6e-9ad2-fb18b7c084cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "072744ce-01eb-4e6e-9ad2-fb18b7c084cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a90badd7-1d31-4f7a-abd9-ca678c30a0c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "1131a41cf0cfa03d12fed7be01ece8aeb2d4e70ef81aec97ea55deb5692cb561", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb30a52c-5040-467a-be6d-d5646313912c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "/Users/pragalvhasharma/Downloads/Prag GO to Documents/Comp Sci/MY Projects/LLamaIndexRag Agent/env/Data/lectures.pdf"}, "hash": "534df49583ee5bc91a4df1962f5d9976c8bc1ce5c182ba92ca823e14e90a9708", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95a60b72-c71a-41f2-bb8f-c464c5e1aca1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e17801e6a40ecffa8671a53a3cfa9041a6e7c9e38ae4ec06043893e2b4cdbb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7701073f679216d7d363cedd6b3276969476343173ead187715a02fb7b4c2962", "text": "you're trying to make the shift from building great product to building a great company?\nSam: What are the most common mistakes to make when you're shifting to building a great company? I think I went\nthrough most of them here. I tried to put everything here that I see people mess up most of the time. Yes.\nAudience member #7: Is there a way to get involved in the Yom community before getting accepted?\nSam: Is there a way to get involved with YC before getting funded? No and intestinally not. I say the one thing you can do\nis if you work at a YC company and then later apply - I think probably like - well not probably that definitely if you get a\ngood recommendation from those founders will help with YC. So you know, working at a YC company helps but there's\nnot much you can do to help. And that's intention. Like there is no pre start up in a way that there is premed. You should\njust focus on whatever doing and then when you start a start up - there are `things like YC and others that are structured\nto help you. Most of the founders we fund we don't know at all before we do it. You know you really don't need to get to\nknopw us or get involved. We're all good that way.\nAudience member #8: The statistic you saying now harder to get into YCombinator than getting into Harvard. So I am\ncurious the criteria\u2019s that you use to pick up startups. Does it change over time?\nSam: The question is what criteria to pick startups and has it gotten harder? Has it changed? The two things that we need\nto see are good founders and a good idea. And without both of those we won't fund the company. But that hasn't\nchanged. That is always been the case. The applicant pool to YC has grown quite a bit. But most of - a lot of the growth is\npeople who shouldn't be starting start up anyone that are just do9ing it 'cause it is sort of the cool thing now. So you know\nif you're really passionate about an idea and the idea is good and you are smart and you get things done and your we\nexecuting - I still think you have a very reasonable shot at YC even though the headline number is bigger.\nAudience member #9: There's a certain market that you\u2019re really excited about that don\u2019t necessarily know all about yet -\nis there a certain track you recommend or ways to?\nSam: Sure - if there's a market that you\u2019re excited about but don\u2019t a lot about yet what should you do? Two schools of\nthought on this. One is to just jump right in. Learn it as you go. That's worked a lot of times. The other is go work at another\ncompany in the space or do something in the market for a year or two years. I lean slightly towards the second but as long\nas you are willing to really learn and really study and to get uncomfortably close to your users - either case would work.\nAnd I don't even thinks that it\u2019s that much of a disadvantage. I think all things being equal go spend a couple of years\nlearning about it in detail but I don't think you have to.\nAudience member #10: I have a question related to YC - So I think YC did a fantastic job in promoting partnership in\nSilicon Valley. In fact, I plan to invest in some in the next three years. You guys pump 180 companies per year coming to\nthe market it looks like its hard to follow each of the YC company any more. Do you think that this will create some - some\npeople will walk away from YC because they cannot follow large batch of companies and the company had to be very\npolished and the firm had to be think of the world about ideas?\nSam: Alright so I think the question is do I think investors are going to fund less YC companies as we grow. No. Definitely\nnot. Like certainly the trend in this is the other way. We have more and more investors saying that half their portfolio is not\nYC companies and they look forward to the day where it's three quarters. No I don't think that\u2019s a problem at all. I think that\nso not on my top hundred problem list. The opposite of that maybe.\nAlright.

One more question.\nAudience member #11: When should a group of founders raise a seed round or Series A?\nSam: In general it's nice to wait until you have the idea figured out and initial signs of promise before you raise money.\nRazing money puts some pressure on the company. Sometime pressure. And once you've raised money you can't be in\nthis exploratory phase in definitely. You end up having to rush and so like if you haven\u2019t raised money and your idea is\nnot working you can fall around and pivot until you really hit on the thing that\u2019s working.
